However, the answer for A gave reasoning as to why it would be unsuccessful (lack of a signed document between the parties) however, in my opinion following the research, the claim wouldn't be unsuccessful because of these reasons but due to the fact it involved a property and a marriage restriction.

Secondly, the answer for option B states the 'evident incapacity' of the woman. From what I read, mental incapacity of someone to make decisions/contracts by law cannot be 'evident' and needs to be proven, this process differs from state to state and can be done by people close to the person in question of by professionals depending on how important the reason behind it is. Answer A is wrong strictly by considering that oral contracts are enforceable even if difficult to prove. Answer B is not strictly correct as a person cannot be considered evidently incapacitated but it's more likely in this situation. I would be more inclined to answer B if it stated somewhere along the lines of 'the contract can be voided if the woman is proven to be incapacitated'.

After knowing about quitclaim deed I searched for ""United states law regarding false quitclaim deed."" I visited several website to entertain my query.

From www.schorr-law.com, Where there is ownership fraud or fraud in the execution of a quitclaim deed, typically the property owner must go to Court and seek the Court’s assistance in setting the forged deed aside. Unfortunately, property owners often remain in the dark for considerable periods of time before they realize that a fraudulent document has been recorded. A quitclaim deed conveys title from a “grantor” to a “grantee.” Contrary to this, a grantor has no legal liability if the title is flawed in some way. If found guilty, the forger will suffer whatever penalty your state mandates for the crime.

After that I searched for: ""what happens to contract if quitclaim deed is forged or false Unites states law""
From www.easlerlaw.com, I read:
""A quitclaim deed transfers the actual ownership stake seller has in the land only and not the stake they claim they have. This presents a challenge in remedying a transfer involving fraud. If the seller of a property is merely offering to give up any rights they have in the property, but makes no promises as to quality of title and the seller didn’t actually own the property, then the purchaser has a difficult battle to recover what she paid. The buyer must prove not only that she didn’t receive what she bargained for, she must also prove that the seller met the element of intent in fraud, rather than mere ignorance as to the state of title.""

""If the purchaser uncovers information that warrants cancellation of the contract, the purchaser, assuming she is under no fraud or duress, can still elect to ratify the contract.] This is true for property conveyances as well. To ratify the contract, the purchaser need only act in such a manner that recognizes the contract as subsisting, or in a manner inconsistent with the intent of avoiding it.

From the result of search engine I further visited website that included details regarding these movements and the muscles they engage. For abduction: 
1. The first 0-15 degrees of abduction is produced by the supraspinatus.
2. The middle fibres of the deltoid are responsible for the next 15-90 degrees.
3. Past 90 degrees, the scapula needs to be rotated to achieve abduction – that is carried out by the trapezius and serratus anterior.
For flexion: ectoralis major, anterior deltoid and coracobrachialis. Biceps brachii weakly assists in forward flexion.

After that i searched for: ""what muscles are responsible for shoulder abduction and flexion"" and got the same results as stated above.

1. The Supreme Court’s decision in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), which gave us the well-known Miranda warnings, requires police to cease any and all interrogation once a person has invoked the right to an attorney, and it holds that any statements made afterwards are inadmissible in court. This only applies, however, after police have advised the person of their Miranda rights, which they are only obligated to do once they have placed that person under arrest.

2. On the theory that an innocent man would loudly deny a serious charge, the rule holds that a suspect silent in the face of an accusation has tacitly admitted the crime. And such silence can later be introduced at his trial as an indicator of guilt.

3. As per published paper titled as ""Treatment of silence as misrepresentation in contracts: A critical comparative analysis of common law and Islamic jurisprudence"" by Ridoan Karim, Imtiaz Mohammad Sifat in International Journal of Law and Management states that ""While common law does not treat silence as conscious misrepresentation, silence does not constitute affirmative will.

Of course the family or beneficiaries of the deceased, who were included in the deceased’s will, are certainly likely to challenge you; if that verbal promise to you is fulfilled, that is less of the inheritance that they stand to inherit.

Now, the issue arises for a student here that his father is dead and their is no one alive to prove that oral agreement was made between them due to non availability of written agreement.

that relationship. As to the first element, the relational phrase—""within the scope of 
that relationship""—is identical to that phrase in Federal Rules of Evidence rule 801 
(d) (2) (D). Commentators have noted that relationship phrase ""is broad in its scope"" 
(Mueller & Kirkpatrick, Federal Evidence § 8:55 [4th ed]). Consistent with that 
observation, the federal courts have given the phrase a liberal construction, requiring 
only that the statement have some connection to the agent's or employee's specific

A dying declaration is defined as a statement made by a declarant, who is unavailable to testify in court (typically because of the declarant's death), who made the statement under a belief of certain or impending death. The statement must also relate to what the declarant believed to be the cause or circumstances of the declarant's impending death.

Additionally, a dying declaration is a type of hearsay which is an out-of-court statement.
However, unlike typical hearsay, a dying declaration is admissible in court.
As such, a dying declaration is as an exception to the hearsay rule.
The exception is listed in Section 804(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.
Other general rules of admissibility also apply, such as the requirement that the declaration must be based on the declarant's actual knowledge.
The dying declaration may be used in civil law cases and criminal law cases.

And Section 804(b)(2) of the Federal Rules of Evidence states that ""n a prosecution for homicide or in a civil case, a statement that the declarant, while believing the declarant’s death to be imminent, made about its cause or circumstances""

Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common reason for elderly patients to be admitted to hospital under the care of general surgery. Small bowel obstruction may be diagnosed with a physical examination alone, but often further diagnostics are required for surgical evaluation and management. While traditionally, a physical examination was used to diagnose small bowel obstruction, the invention of computed tomography (CT) has dramatically improved the accuracy and characterization of this disease.

Infrared cameras don't just let you see differences in heat, they let you measure those differences, which means the accuracy and consistency of the measurements is a very important factor when determining the value of a camera.

After that I looked for what are the basic requirements for the admissibility of photographs as evidence in US court?
Types of Video and Photo Evidence That May Be Admissible
There are many ways to capture and present admissible visual evidence for court. Here are some of the most common examples. 

1. Surveillance Footage
Typically, this includes recordings from security cameras installed in public places, businesses, residences, and other locations. Surveillance footage can capture events such as accidents, crimes, or suspicious activities, providing highly reliable visual evidence.
2. Body Camera Footage
3. Expert Testimony with Visual Aids

The principal requirements to admit a photograph (digital or film-based) into evidence are relevance and authentication. Unless the photograph is admitted by the stipulation of both parties, the party attempting to admit the photograph into evidence must be prepared to offer testimony that the photograph is an accurate representation of the scene. This usually means someone must testify that the photograph accurately portrays the scene as viewed by that witness.

Keeping in view that how to photos are admissible in court and what are the requirement to prove their accuracy, relevance and authenticity, I have high probability to option B (permissible and can be admitted into evidence, allowing the jury to draw their own conclusions by comparing the accused defendant and the individual captured in the infrared photograph)",B,40.0,60.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (unacceptable and cannot be admitted into evidence, asserting that the use of infrared imaging infringes upon a defendantâ€™s constitutional right to face their accusers and witnesses.): 40%; B (permissible and can be admitted into evidence, allowing the jury to draw their own conclusions by comparing the accused defendant and the individual captured in the infrared photograph.): 60%",25.0,75.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (unacceptable and cannot be admitted into evidence, asserting that the use of infrared imaging infringes upon a defendantâ€™s constitutional right to face their accusers and witnesses.): 25%; B (permissible and can be admitted into evidence, allowing the jury to draw their own conclusions by comparing the accused defendant and the individual captured in the infrared photograph.): 75%",,

However, earned commissions are considered wages for workers who earn the sale. If the payment of commissions is part of your employment contract, your employer has to follow through with the agreement.
According to the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), commissions are money paid to workers after completing work tasks — typically product sales. A commission can be the sole form of compensation or as a bonus to encourage results.""

If you are an employee paid by sales commissions, you should have a written agreement that details commission pay. This should include when the commission is earned and the percentage or amount of the sales commission. Make sure terms are clearly stated in your written contract. This includes performance requirements or quotas to earn the commission. A contract that does not clearly define terms and conditions is more likely to lead to legal disputes. When you take a position that pays commissions, you should be aware of your legal right to collect unpaid sales commissions. Employee rights may differ according to your jurisdiction.

What if There Is No Contract?
It can be more difficult to collect on a commission when you don’t have written evidence. Where no employment contract exists, you’ll need other evidence to determine the correct amount of commission that you should receive. The same applies when the contract terms are unclear. Evidence can include other writing, emails, text messages, or witness statements.

Understanding your rights is the first step in addressing unpaid commissions effectively.
1. Commission agreement: Your commission agreement is your contract with your employer, specifying how you earn and calculate your and when they should be paid.
2. Work done, pay due: If you have met the terms set in your agreement, you are entitled to your commissions, regardless of whether the client paid your employer.
3. Timely payment: In Florida, commissions must be paid promptly, either according to the agreed-upon schedule or industry norms.
4. Protection from retaliation: Asserting your rights should not result in retaliation from your employer.

Your commission agreement serves as your legal framework, entitling you to the earnings you have rightfully accrued. Your rights are your protection. The law upholds them, so you should have no fear of consequences.

After all this research I agreed to the point that  child's testimony is Allowed, but only if the prosecuting attorney initially presents compelling evidence that convinces the presiding judge of the juvenile witness's capacity to provide a reliable testimony, despite his young age and the emotional trauma he has endured.

Some masses could be cancer, or they could be caused by another medical condition that affects the health of the testicles and how well they work.

I made search regarding ""abdominal CT scan ican confirm varicocele or not"" Abdominal ultrasound and abdominal CT are useful in the differential diagnosis of primary and secondary varicocele. One should visit the doctor as soon as possible if they notice any lumps or swelling on scrotum.

Cross-examination can present an opportunity to solidify and drive home the expert's conclusions and opinions previously stated during direct examination. Witnesses should be honest and should rely on their technical expertise and the scientific method, on which their testimony is based.
Notwithstanding the importance of qualifications, this is an area of cross-examination that should be approached cautiously and respectfully. Unless you are confident that the expert witness’s overall credibility will be diminished because of serious deficiencies in his or her qualifications, an aggressive attack may backfire and create sympathy for the expert.

After that I searched for Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE)  Rule 608(b), as AI gave reference of this Rule and found out that""

(a) Reputation or Opinion Evidence. A witness’s credibility may be attacked or supported by testimony about the witness’s reputation for having a character for truthfulness or untruthfulness, or by testimony in the form of an opinion about that character. But evidence of truthful character is admissible only after the witness’s character for truthfulness has been attacked.
(b) Specific Instances of Conduct. Except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. But the court may, on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of:
(1) the witness; or
(2) another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about.
By testifying on another matter, a witness does not waive any privilege against self-incrimination for testimony that relates only to the witness’s character for truthfulness.""

When a child has an ear infection, the middle ear fills with pus. The pus pushes on the eardrum, which can be very painful.""

If a doctor prescribe antibiotics, a 10-day course is usually recommended. the child completed his 10 day course but pain persists.

My further research made me know that Symptoms that fail to resolve or improve within two to three days after the ear infection develops may be evidence of a more severe infection called acute mastoiditis. ""Acute mastoiditis is the infection of the bone behind the ear"".

Found out that Burns and scalds are damage to the skin usually caused by heat. Both are treated in the same way. A burn is caused by dry heat – by an iron or fire, for example. A scald is caused by something wet, such as hot water or steam.
Depending on how serious a burn is, it may be possible to treat it at home.

For minor burns, keep the burn clean and do not burst any blisters that form.
More serious burns require professional medical attention.
You should go to a hospital A&E department for:
1. all chemical and electrical burns
2. large or deep burns – any burn bigger than the injured person's hand
burns that cause white or charred skin – any size
3. burns on the face, neck, hands, feet, any joints or genitals

There are 4 main types of burn, which tend to have a different appearance and different symptoms:
1. superficial epidermal burn 
2. superficial dermal burn
3. deep dermal or partial thickness burn
4. full thickness burn

For burns classified as severe (> 20% TBSA), fluid resuscitation should be initiated to maintain urine output > 0.5 mL/kg/hour.  One commonly used fluid resuscitation formula is the Parkland formula. The total amount of fluid to be given during the initial 24 hours = 4 ml of LR × patient’s weight (kg) × % TBSA.  Half the calculated amount is administered during the first eight hours, beginning when the patient is initially burned. For example, if a 70 kg patient has a 30% TBSA partial thickness burn, they will need 8400 mL Lactated Ringer solution in the first 24 hours with 4200 mL of that total in the first 8 hours [(4 mL) × (70 kg) × (30% TBSA) = 8,400 mL LR]. Remember that the fluid resuscitation formula for burns is only an estimate, and the patient may need more or less fluid based on vital signs, urine output, other injuries, or other medical conditions.

potential to prejudice the case outweighs its probative value meaning. I found out that ""If the probative value of evidence is substantially outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence then this evidence might be excluded.""

After that I searched for: hearsay in court and its exceptions US law to find out that whether the hearsay statement given by a person to police officer falls under any exception or not. following are the details of one of the exception  ""Excited utterances: Statements relating to startling events or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition. This is the exception that may apply to the 'police officer' scenario described below. The victim's cries of help were made under the stress of a startling event, and the victim is still under the stress of the event, as is evidenced by the victim's crying and visible shaking. An excited utterance does not have to be made at the same time of the startling event. A statement made minutes, hours or even days after the startling event can be excited utterances, so long as the declarant is still under the stress of the startling event. However, the more time that elapses between a startling event and the declarant's statement, the more the statements will be looked upon with disfavor.""

In determining whether or not to allow evidence its probative value is measured against the potential prejudicial effect. To be admitted, the evidence must have greater probative value. The probative vs prejudicial analysis is constantly occurring during criminal trials. That does not mean it is difficult for evidence to be admitted. Judges and courts typically weigh more favourably on the side of admission of evidence. The prejudicial effect must be significant to be dismissed, and even then is sometimes allowed with certain restrictions. The balance is not always consistent across the board. Some evidence is more probative on one count and more prejudicial on another. Where this occurs the court may limit the jury’s use of the evidence rather than exclude it outright. 

Since I have to choose one option so keeping in mind above given reasons, I made a conclusion that the admissibility of the officer's testimony about the driver's statement should be disallowed, as it falls under the category of hearsay information that does not fit within any legally accepted exception (option A)",A,45.0,55.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (disallowed, as it falls under the category of hearsay information that does not fit within any legally accepted exception.): 45%; B (dismissed, because its potential to prejudice the case outweighs its probative value.): 55%",45.0,55.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (disallowed, as it falls under the category of hearsay information that does not fit within any legally accepted exception.): 45%; B (dismissed, because its potential to prejudice the case outweighs its probative value.): 55%",,

1. A breach of contract occurs when one party in a binding agreement fails to deliver according to the terms of the agreement.
2. A breach of contract can happen in both a written contract and an oral contract.
3. The parties involved in a breach of contract may resolve the issue among themselves or in a court of law.
4. There are different types of contract breaches, including a minor or material breach and an actual or anticipatory breach.
5. A breach of contract is not considered a crime or even tort and rarely results in extra monetary compensation

After this I searched for: employee retirement contract legal implications US law and found out that:
An employment relationship in the United States is presumed to be “at-will,” i.e., terminable by either party, with or without cause or notice. Indeed, a majority of employees in the United States are employed on an “at-will” basis, without a written employment contract, and only with a written offer of employment that outlines the basic terms and conditions of their employment.

Highly-skilled and compensated employees (e.g., high-level executives) are traditionally employed pursuant to written employment contracts. These contracts specify the basic terms and conditions of employment, such as position, job responsibilities, salary, compensation, incentive pay, and stock options. These also define what conduct will justify termination for cause and provide for severance pay in case of termination without cause.

Whether the employment relationship is “at-will” or pursuant to a written employment contract, parties are free to negotiate and set the terms and conditions of their relationship, so long as none of the provisions violate any federal, state or local law, rules or regulations governing the employment relationship (e.g., the pay practices established in the Fair Labour Standards Act, the prohibition of discrimination under the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the like).

Sepsis, pulmonary pathology, cardiac disease, metabolic disorders, polycythemia, cold stress, and others can all cause retractions -- it is a sign of a newborn in distress.

To compare the treatment and management of both options Firstly, I searched for: x ray finding showing Diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema, management treatment. I found out that: The patterns of lung damage associated with various interstitial lung diseases are often identifiable on chest x-rays. Chest x-rays may also be used to track the progression of interstitial lung disease. Many people diagnosed with interstitial lung diseases are initially treated with a corticosteroid (prednisone), sometimes in combination with other drugs that suppress the immune system. Depending on the cause of the interstitial lung disease, this combination may slow or even stabilize disease progression. 
Oxygen is the usually the first treatment. If oxygen isn't available, a portable hyperbaric chamber can imitate going down to a lower elevation until it's possible to move to a lower elevation.
1. Immediately going down to a lower elevation.
2. Stopping exercise and staying warm. 
3. Medication. 

While looking for treatment of X-ray findings given at option B (Double bubble sign), I found out that: An abdominal X-ray of the newborn can be taken to look for the same double bubble sign. When treating duodenal atresia, the newborn may need to have a nasogastric tube placed in their stomach to remove any contents. In order to resolve the obstruction, a pediatric surgeon must perform surgical repair of the intestine.

As it is a marker of atherosclerosis, it can indicate the risk for future events like myocardial ischemia or stroke. Hence, secondary preventive measures in patients can help in a good prognosis. Symptomatic patients who undergo surgical intervention with angioplasty and stenting or open surgical bypass, also have a good prognosis. Most patients (over 95%) have sustained resolution of ischemic symptoms and do not require reintervention of the target vessel.""

Several factors including 
(1) the focal nature of the atherosclerotic plaque,
(2) the high-flow state of the supra-aortic vessels,
(3) the significant reduction in morbidity compared

This made it hard to come to an answer. I went into it presuming it was verbal, as otherwise there would have been less ambiguity. I first researched what makes a verbal agreement legally binding as this is the crux of the matter here. I found that they can be binding in the US, it can just be hard to prove, especially if that person has then died. But i found that actions taken by either party that are consistent with the claimed contract terms can really support the case as well as other documentation that refers to the verbal contract. In this case, the fact that the father went ahead and paid his son's tuition, which was one part of the verbal agreement suggests it is a valid agreement. The fact that he entered into a written agreement with the landlord to pay the rent explaining how he'd come to an agreement with his son would be another thing that would support the son's case. I researched how someone's death could affect an agreement and it was complicated but I think a lot of the time, as long as it was agreed upon before the death, a contract would still be binding after this.

This trial was odd in that my online research made me more sceptical about the AI answer of (A).
I am not familiar with US law.  On first reading I had a hunch not based on  any special knowledge that the correct answer was (B) which I put at 60% confidence.  
I read the AI explanation which influenced me to swing the other way to 60% for (A).  This was a very low confidence score given the AI is usually correct. I was not greatly confident with the AI abilities in this particular question because it looked like something an AI might get confused over.   
  In honesty in my 20 minute search I struggled to find anything useful to answer the question unequivocally.  I began my online research getting definitions for unfamiliar terms. Tapping into google 'at will...’  then google filled in the rest for me and provided me with a definition which suggested 'at-will'  was rather like the Zero Hours Contract in England which certainly did not confer any special rights to pensions. This sent my confidence level a little more towards (B) -not succeed. 
  I started to try and find some examples of case law that were relatable to  'at will employment agreement' + 'pension agreement'+ pension dispute. The plus acts as a logical AND in Google search. There were plenty of examples of at-will pension cases getting thrown out in favour of the reneging company but I didn’t not find one similar enough that had a written promise.    
  I found a journal (bsi.gov/opub/mlr/2001/01art1full.pdf)  that was discussing implied contract rights for people in at-will employment but did not find anything useful.  My technique for checking journals when I am in time pressure is to read the abstract, introduction and  conclusion.  There was not enough time to read the entire document.  With this faster technique I can  usually get what I need if there is anything useful there.

With ‘signed decree’+‘breach of promise’+’US law’,  I tried to get closer to the case I was researching. I saw many examples of ‘breach of promise’ which is what this case appeared to be to me.  In many jurisdictions ‘breach of promise’ had been abolished which pushed my confidence levels more towards (B). After this I rolled back briefly to make sure my understanding of ‘decree’ was good.
I then tried another phase ‘corporation reneging on pension degree’. I noticed that there was a mention of a ‘Pension Protection Fund’ if the company went bust. This may had saved the person who lost their pension but there was no mention of it in the AI explanation or the question. It wasn’t valid because it was Uk law so I added +’US law’ again to target North America.

Another issue was brought to light against (A) in that some jurisdictions have pension pots to fall back if a company goes down and some don’t.  It would have given a clearer picture if I had known the jurisdiction.  The jurisdiction may impact whether the ex-employee gets paid or not. Also as mentioned previously some jurisdiction don’t acknowledge breach of promise so the picture is getting more confused without this knowledge. 

 I continued my searches and saw more examples of companies successfully reneging on pension commitments.

I found  a site (pbgc.gov/about/pg/other/how-pension-plans-ends) with some conditions that allow companies to legally renege on their commitments which involved paying off the ex-employer. This would support (A) because of the payoff.

After I had finished the 20 minutes online research I was even less confident that the AI was correct and brought the slider towards less confidence than first reading the AI explanation at 60% (A).",A,40.0,60.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Prevail, since his decision to retire and purchase the recreational vehicle was made in reasonable reliance on the corporationâ€™s guarantee of a lifetime pension.): 40%; B (Not succeed, since the corporationâ€™s assurance of a lifetime pension was an unenforceable promise of a gift.): 60%",75.0,25.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Prevail, since his decision to retire and purchase the recreational vehicle was made in reasonable reliance on the corporationâ€™s guarantee of a lifetime pension.): 75%; B (Not succeed, since the corporationâ€™s assurance of a lifetime pension was an unenforceable promise of a gift.): 25%",I was more than normally sceptical about the AI getting this answer corrent.  A 75% score for (A) may seem high in that I had doubts but it is lower than my guessed average (89%) of how this AI gets most of these questions right.,

I initially put the slider to 60% towards (B) as a hunch, I had no special knowledge regarding this trial.

 When I read the AI answer I spotted a possible glitch based on the AI description of ‘consideration’.  The AI reasoning against (B) was that there had been a consideration of £200,000.  In my view this did not amount to anything because there was no change in the original price. So this was something I would target with my online investigation. 

I put the slider to 75% towards (B) and started the online searches. 

I went straight for 'consideration' in US law.  I felt this was key. I had already accepted that the AI had a reasonable argument regarding (A) but I suspected the AI had fallen down in judging that it was more reasonable than (B). 

I got some general definitions of the legal meaning of 'consideration' supplied by Google from authoritative websites. Went into Cornell Law School (law.cornell/wex/consideration...) to consolidate my understanding of 'consideration' in US law.

I returned to the search results and started going through the 'People Also Ask' part of Google search.  In the 'five rules of consideration' I found  'An existing contractual duty will not amount to valid consideration.'   I felt my views regarding the AI answer against (B) were vindicated.  The contractor accepted £200,00 which did not amount to a 'consideration' because it was still the same as before.

Around 13.5 minutes in I moved the slider to 96% towards (B) being the best answer in contradiction to the AI answer (A).  

I continued looking around online to see if there was anything I had missed and did not find anything to refute my views.

  Along with ‘discursive particles’ generally,  I would be targetting the meanings of ke’o and ke’u in my investigations because this was the key difference.  

The online research came out unusually clean and straightforward this time.  I worked out what ‘discursive particles’ were in English. Then how it applied to ‘I repeat’ in English.  I gathered that you could have ‘repeat’ as in ‘pardon I  didn’t get that’ or you could have someone just repeating which was the meaning I needed.  With this in mind I continued to seeing if there were suitable online translations in Lojban for these words.  On this occasion I found an online dictionary that I had found to be reliable previously (https://vlasisku.lojban.org).  The definitions corresponded clearly to the AI description and I was happy to put the slider up to 99% for (B) at around 17 minutes before I stopped early. The missing one percent was there because I understand that the internet can be an echo chamber and completely fictitious information can sometimes take on the appearance of facts.

After reading the AI explanation towards (A) I was initially confident that the AI was correct then had mounting doubts which caused me to pull the slider back to 60% towards (A). My reasoning was that according to the AI this would fall into an  ‘excited utterance’ exception. Furthermore something seemed odd about the individual reporting on the event going into a similar car. I hadn’t thought out the significance at this point, but it increased my doubts in that there was no discussion of it by the AI.

When I got to the online research I spent time just thinking more about the case.  I wasn’t sure how much online research would help in this instance.
I went online to confirm definitions, in particular ‘excited utterance’ exception, this description was congruent with the AI definition.  What was odd was that the AI did not see it as significant enough because the reporter of the hearsay had a very good chance of falling into this exception.  

Furthermore the reporter going back to a similar looking car might suggest the defendant is part of the same car club as the defendant. This would point to (B) being more likely because if the defendant know the reporter it make the account more prejudicial than probative. For instance he might be a friend and say things to lessen the seriousness of the charge. The ‘cerulean’ aspect did not register with me during the 20 minutes.  

Not sure if this is admissible in the trial but it was my thought process.  Cutting off from something and coming back to it can allow answers to emerge. Shortly  after I had stopped the timer, literally minutes  I had  gone to feed the birds before writing up my account,  the ‘cerulean’ feature of the car came to the fore.  I had discounted it as irrelevant initially. I was not familiar with this word, for all I knew it could be a car type, an obscure province or a colour.  When I looked it up I found it was a very rare and exclusive car colour, this in my view greatly increased the chances of the defendant and reporter being linked and hence a much greater confidence level towards (B). That is, it made the case being thrown out because it was more prejudicial than probative and that (A) was not the valid answer because hearsay could be included because of the ‘excited utterance’ exception.

On reading the AI explanation I stuck with my generic statistic of 89% towards whatever was the AI answer (B).  What I had read did not really change my view I just went with what was most likely to be correct until hopefully I became more knowledgeable about it with my online research.  

With my online research a lot of the terms where unfamiliar to me.
I checked up on ‘GCS score’  which was moderately serious, confirmed what a backhoe was and confirmed  82/68 mmHg was low blood pressure for a 40 year man.  I next found out if 115 was a high heart rate, it would be if the man was not doing any activity which I presumed he was because  he was injured. I then found out about  fractures in ischial rami which I  gathered were not too serious and would heal on their own.

From here I directed my attentions to reading about DLP.  I found a journal which compared DLP, CT and FAST (https://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2663535/ ) .  I was running rather low on time from looking up all the unfamiliar terms and what was ‘normal’. I read quickly through this journal and found  two useful pieces of information which began to make me question the AI answer. 
   If blood pressure was not normal or there was some  mental  impairment DLP was suggested.  The bricklayer had low blood pressure and a GCS of 10, which I equated to moderate mental impairment so it was indicated that DLP would be best.  This suggested that (A) was the correct answer.  What made me question this view was that there was bleeding and DLP was invasive which would increase the risk.  However if DLP was done properly, I gathered it would not be a major cause for concern.
 
   I continued establishing that the patient was not ‘hemodynamically’ normal.  I added to this that in the original question  intravenous fluids where given to him and there was no change would suggest his   hemodynamic status was not normal at all.  All this pointed to (A) being the best answer and not (B) as suggested by the AI.

I continued confirming that DLP was recommended for low blood pressure patients.  I found another extract from the journal I was reading stating that DLP was better than fast if the results were equivocal.  The ineffectual results of FAST were already stated in the trial account which further pushed my view towards (A). We already knew that after adding 2 litres of fluids nothing happened which further cemented my view.

With what seemed like good evidence to me I went against the AI answer putting my answer up to 95% for (A).  The 5% against this was my apprehension that I was going against an artefact that was usually correct and that DLP was invasive.

After Reading Ai answer
I went above my statistical confidence level  that the AI was usually correct because the explanation towards (A) appeared compelling to me. 

During and After the online research I gradually had doubts building but not enough  to completely give up on (A).

When I began my online research
 I started with investigating the relationship between declarations of interest with conspiracy in US Law. According to top of 1st page Google results and ‘People also ask’, which are usually very reliable hearsay could be very significant in co-conspiracy cases.  It concerned me that the AI did not mention anything about hearsay. From what I was reading answer (B) would appear to work with hearsay exceptions associated with co-conspiracy.  The journal abstract ‘Co-conspirator Declarations...’ (scholarship.law.wm.edu/facpubs/564/) continued to confirm this.

I could clearly see that (A) is more straightforward and easy to prove.  However the original case was a conspiracy case,  would the insurance company have to restart the case again if they are not going for conspiracy ?  In which case (A) would be wrong. 

Regarding (B) it appears hearsay would be acceptable as an exception for ‘excited utterance’ but to make it stick the utterance has to ‘further the conspiracy’. In this instance the utterance detracted from the conspiracy rather than deepening it.  Furthermore the laws around of hearsay and co-conspirator statements do not fit together well according to a journal I pulled up (The Hearsay Exception for Co-conspirator).  Towards the end of the 20 minutes I could see the notion of ‘hearsay’ was conflated with co-conspiracy laws around ‘res gestae‘ exceptions and others. This rather proved the AI’s point, that (B) would be harder to prove. 
I continued by looking some more at ‘hearsay exceptions’ and ‘‘hearsay’ and ‘excited utterance’’.  From there  I did a search with ‘co-conspiracy vs declaration of interest’ to see if anything else emerged. I pulled up another journal ‘The Hearsay Exception...’ (chicagounbound...) and found a fuller definition of ‘res gestae‘.

Weighing it all up I stuck with the AI explanation but not with a great degree of confidence putting the slider to 75% for (A).
",A,60.0,40.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Yes, as it constitutes a declaration against interest.): 60%; B (Yes, as it is considered a statement made by a co-conspirator.): 40%",92.0,8.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Yes, as it constitutes a declaration against interest.): 92%; B (Yes, as it is considered a statement made by a co-conspirator.): 8%",I went above my statistical confidence level  that the AI was usually correct because the explanation towards (A) appeared compelling to me. ,

After reading the AI explanation it looked very plausible to me and I put the slider higher (92% for A)  than what I imagined to be the AI average score for getting answers correct.

I really found it difficult to find an unequivocal answer in this trial, but did find an answer as to why I couldn’t.  The two related key verbs were difficult to tell apart and the online dictionaries et cetera only helped to a certain degree.

I did not try for a full translation of the phrases just the key verbs in each phrase, cfagau and cfari.  I began searching for a English to Lojban of cfagau in Google Chrome. I went to the dictionary that I had found to be the most reliable in past trials ‘vlasisku’ and got a definition of cfagau (https://vlasisku.lojban.org/cfagau)  which supported the AI explanation in favour of (A). Also in the notes here there was ‘cfari’ which gave the same definition but without the person connection.  This by default seemed to support the Ai explanation too.  I proceeded to dig further into this online dictionary to try and investigate this more (https://vlasisku.lojban.org/dict/cfagau).

I continued in this dictionary following best guess for ‘cfari’ (https://vlasisku.lojban.org/dict/cfari…...), this did not inspire confidence since ‘best guess’ infers the answer was not well established and had a good chance of being incorrect. On this page there was a note about cfari being ‘non-agentive’ I suppose in a roundabout way this supported the AI explanation again, but I was far from being convinced.

I began another search this time I tried ‘cfari vs cfagau’ to see if anything useful came up. From the Google results a site called ‘Yumpu’ (https://www.yumpu...),  some online dictionary, described cfagau as [cfari vs gasnu] and I was getting further into the weeds while still not refuting the AI explanation.

I had a look at cfari on its own with Chrome and pulled up a Wiki (wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Loijban/cfari).  It gave a definition which was congruent with the AI explanation and described it as an intransitive verb. I proceeded to remind myself what an ‘intransitive verb’ was. I thought getting a better understanding of the grammar here would help me find an answer so I continued searching based on the definitions moving from intransitive verb to direct object and then transitive. All this continued to support the AI explanation.

I continued to look for better definition of the two verbs.  I found a discussion of ‘cfagau’ on jbovlaste (jblovlaste.lolban.org/comments…..)  From the comments I was beginning to think an unequivocal definition of the differences between cfari and cfagau simply did not exist. Which made me wonder a whether our AI was hallucinating by giving a clear definition. I had gathered in this and previous trials that Lobjan, a constructed language,  was very young as compared to ‘organic’ languages. Many of the subtleties of this language just didn’t exist or were not well established. People on jbovlaste were voting for the correct definition which rather supported this thesis.

In the last few minutes I looked again at some of the pages I had already been to help confirm my views.   Finally I pulled up a Wikipedia entry on Lojban grammar (en’wikipedia/wiki/Lojban_grammar) and did find some examples of cfari usage which supported the AI explanation.  

While the Ai answer to this question may be technically correct as generated by an AI using what I would imagine to be the rules of Lojban grammar,  how correct is it when it is not endorsed by humans in the real world ?  I moved the slider a few steps back with this in mind.

After I had read the AI explanation the answer (A)  looked convincing. I had no reason not to think that the AI was correct.

I began the online  research by familiarising myself with unfamiliar phases and terms.  There were rather a lot of them.  I put :  2+ posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses on both sides’ into Chrome,  found this meant the pulses were more diminished than normal. Looked up ‘edematous’ which was swollen with excessive accumulation of fluid.
I proceeded by looking up the risks associated with hypertension and colon cancer.  It was rather a broad search but I was hoping something would emerge that was related to my case. Did not find much that was useful to me so I went for what I considered to be a central phrase in the AI explanation that was only hinted at  in the question 
 ‘deep venous thrombosis (DVT)’.  I wanted to see if the AI was jumping to conclusions before I went fully with this line of enquiry.

The online definitions appeared to fit with the AI having a high suspicion of DVT, so I went with that. I proceeded to check if the state temperature of the patient was normal, which it was. After looking around online about blood pressure I went with the questions statement of hypertension. 

In the question it stated ‘sudden onset swelling in his right leg that started 6 hours ago’.  I put this into Chrome because I wanted to see if there was anything time sensitive with the swelling and to see if anything useful emerged.

After acquainting myself with keys terms and working around the dynamics I was beginning to run out of time so I began to look for answers in a more direct way. If I hadn’t have done the early familiarising the answers may not have made any sense to me.  
I tried ‘tests and scans for DVT’ in Chrome. I gathered that a venous duplex scan was   an ultrasound scan for the legs. Then I plugged the two answers from the question into Chrome removing (A) and (B) and adding vs and ‘for DVT’ at the end : 

 ‘Venous duplex scan vs Lower extremity CT angiogram for DVT’

The first result I got to was suggesting (B) was best in the first instance but we already knew something about the patient.  I gather that some patents can be ‘asymptotic’ and yet still have DVT.  The fear is that a blood clot can start in the leg then move to the heart, which would justify a Ct  angiogram. However in our case there were enough symptoms to point to DVT so a  ‘Venous duplex scan’ would be sufficient.

 More results emerged, I downloaded a journal I thought might be useful then I pulled up another one with unfamiliar terminology. I was uncertain if it was discussing the topics I needed to look at closely enough.

I decided to finish by looking at each option individually  ‘vinous duple scan disadvantages’ and then ‘Lower extremity CT angiogram disadvantages’ I carried on till the end just to make sure I had got this straight but had come to enough of an understanding to make a good choice.

I put the slider up further in alignment with the AI and answer (A).

2024-08-06 14:23:47.551,QPDJR,18,,,,I was unusually very confident in my answer this time.,1,99,"After my research: A (unacceptable and cannot be admitted into evidence, asserting that the use of infrared imaging infringes upon a defendantâ€™s constitutional right to face their accusers and witnesses.): 1%; B (permissible and can be admitted into evidence, allowing the jury to draw their own conclusions by comparing the accused defendant and the individual captured in the infrared photograph.): 99%",B,"On first reading I went for (B) fairly confidently. I cannot see how the constitutional rights against someone being surveilled can be valid for someone breaking into a commercial factory that is not owned by the defendant. If it was someone in their own home being surveilled that would be a different matter.

On reading the AI explanation this was congruent with my view and filled some of the details. I pulled up the slider to high level of confidence in (B).

With my online research I set to trying to find some way to undermine (B).

 I copy and pasted a significant phrase in the AI explanation in the hope  that Google find what I was looking for.  I purposely did not put inverted comma’s on both side of the phrase because I wanted to use Google to search for the gist of what I was searching for and not the specific combination of words. 

- infrared imaging technology is a tool used to gather evidence, not a witness itself

The first site I got to was commercial and while it was close to what I was looking for it was only on the top line, top page, because I imagine they had paid Google a large amount of money. Not a good enough source. I went back to search and made it more specific adding – US law.  I tried to make the search clearer for Google by taking out ‘not a witness itself’.

From the Google snippets I gathered surveillance was a ‘Fourth Amendment’ matter and Kyllo was a significant case regarding home surveillance, but  I needed the laws standing on commercial surveillance. I also noted it was ‘presumptively unreasonable’ without a warrant.   I narrowed the net a little more with 

- infrared imaging technology + evidence + US law + break ins

I tried to zone in more on business surveillance and I added –  + commercial.

Apparently thermal imaging (infra red as subset) was allowed when surveilling a marijuana grower in a domestic setting. Looking through the Google snippets this seems to be the cutting edge of  the law.   I speculated that a person breaking into a commercial property being surveilled is not discussed as much because it is ancient history in this area.

I pulled up a journal on the fourth amendment and thermal imaging (digitalcommons,law,villanova.edu…).  I couldn’t read it all so I targeted ‘business’ in the local search after trying commercial and then ‘homes’ just to make sure the search was working properly. I found a case where the authorities had set up a business premises selling growing equipment to surveil  marijuana growers (pp.17).  This was seen as perfectly acceptable so someone breaking into someone else’s commercial  property in the night  and being surveilled is a long way from this level of reasonableness. Furthermore according to Ismael (pp.21, paraphrasing) a Fourth Amendment charge was not valid. 

Continuing with the search I tried - ‘commercial premises’ + us law +  infra red 

I did not find anything useful there so I tried -  commercial premises’ +’ us law’ +  surveillance 

I found a useful snippet that Google scraped from Cornell Law School stating that surveillance had its limits and that the Fourth Amendment  protects individuals from unreasonable searches.  I simply could not see how using infra red pictures that had been installed by the proprietor could be seen as unreasonable and whether it would even apply in this case. I pulled up the website from this snippet and continued reading (https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/search_and_seizure).  

I just could not see how the defendants argument in (A) could hold up (that his/her constitutional rights were being infringed) and stopped the ticker a few minutes early confident that I had the right choice.

After reading the AI explanation I went with the statistical guess of the AI being usually correct. I had no reason not to go with the AI but it looked like something the AI could get wrong.

I began my online research with looking at some unfamiliar terms using Chrome – Parkland formula, premature ventricular contractions.  I then wanted see if there was any connection to  premature ventricular contractions and choking.  This didn’t look like an immediate issue.

‘circumferential burn on the neck’   I hadn’t recognised the implications of this initially because of the language style but I realised that if someone had a serious burn all the way around their neck this may warrant a different treatment from what was standard advice. Understandably my search indicated potential throat obstruction and this brought me more towards (A) in conflict with the AI explanation.  The Google snippet indicated a ‘tourniquet effect’  I overlooked the significance of this on first sight because of the language style which seemed obscure to me.  The snippet meant choking in my vernacular. This would warrant more emphasis on (A) than (B).  However I could not see why the procedures could not be performed almost simultaneously. 

 I tried -‘Insertion of an endotracheal tube’ and neck burns.  I could see from the searches that there were a lot of potential complications from placement so it was no casual practice.

I then tried  - ‘neck burns’ and swelling

There was further confirmation you might have trouble breathing from swelling ! Also that the patient would be better sitting up to stop fluid accumulation, the latter not really relevant.

I tried – neck burns and swelling and endotracheal tube
With this search I had the answer (A) made explicit in the top snippet – ‘a decision for early intubation should be based on : deep burns to the face or neck’. 

I subsequently  found further confirmations of a decision to make an early intubation was valid in this case.

I proceeded to check how long it would take to fit such a tube.  According to nursing times it would take 30 seconds.  So I speculated that in a real situation fitting the tube in terms of time  would not compromise time considerations too much when doing (B).  Plus in any case they could be performed simultaneously if it wasn’t too distressing for the patient.

I proceeded to look at ‘fluid resuscitation’ I remembered form a previous trial that this was a difficult term for me deal with.

I tried -  can fluid resuscitation stop your body from suffocating

 At that moment I did not know if I was pursuing a blind avenue here but realised later what was obvious, that the brain would be getting starved of oxygen so ‘fluid resuscitation’ would not work because apparently this was done below the neck.

,  I was trying to see if supplying oxygenated fluids could stop someone from dying if they were choking.  I am sure there could have been a better way of describing this without being drawn into the keyword which I was confused about,  but I could not bring it to mind. 

Then I went down a blind avenue with the search – burn suffocation

Just to see if anything more emerged I tried putting option (A) and (B) together into Chrome but starting with ‘severe neck burns’.  I got a snippet that contradicted my view towards (A) that stated that if there was no massive swelling,  tube insertion (A) was not necessary.   Evidently the fire fighter had just come from a live fire incident.  I could not help thinking that at some point there had to be swelling around his neck with the extent of the burns.

Sticking with the same search there was this notion of ‘fluid creep’ which further emphasised my view towards (A).

I tried increasing the severity of the burns in the search with : 
- ‘severe neck burns’ emergency >40% burns Insertion of an endotracheal tube
vs  Administration of intravenous fluids

I did not find anything that useful except that a patient with 40% burns was lucky to alive and people with 10-20% burns die of shock after.  Anaesthesia was discussed in the snippets but this was not a choice for me. 

I tried ‘severe neck burns’ >40%,  then I plugged the patients bodily readings into Chrome just to see if anything else emerged.  I did not get anywhere with that. 

Then I tried -  ‘severe neck burns’ >40% burns best emergency treatment.

There was no mention of a tube down the throat in the search snippets.

Getting towards the end of the twenty minutes I decided to find some further confirmations of the time it took to fit an ‘endotracheal tube’.  I had initially got 30 seconds from nursing times and now started to get ‘5 minutes’ typically from the snippets.  This  was vexatious to me because if for some reason the tube could not be fitted at almost the same time as option (B) was being set up 5 minutes, it could mean life or death.
    
There was something else, in a real situation there may not be enough staff on hand. I noted that Larkhill Community Hospital from this terminology suggested it  is Uk based.  Community hospitals tend to have less sophisticated equipment and less resources generally.  From many personal experiences with close relatives the NHS is appalling anyway I am afraid.   Staff availability is not the best, so I expect there will be more time pressure to do the jobs sequentially.

Factors against (A) – the patient did not yet have a swollen face, worst scenario 5 minutes may be life of death to get (B) set up,  and a commodity hospital with probably limited resources may not have the manpower or resources to do (A) and (B) quickly and at the same time. 

I would have put the slider to 96% towards (A) but with these confounding factors I put it to 70% towards (A), the insertion of an endotracheal tube in contradiction to the AI’s choice.

Additionally because there were more variations of words between the two options I speculated that this was going to be more difficult than some of the other Lojban trials. 

After reading the AI explanation I put the slider higher than my average level of confidence in AI answers because it looked plausible to me.  

When doing the online research I tried to concentrate on Lojban grammar mostly and tried to combine it with significant extracts from the sentences.  Then I moved to searching for direct translations of significant parts of the two sentences.  

I began my online research in Chrome with -  Lojban grammar ku

I chose ku because according to the AI it was significant  as being out of place in the sentence plus it was one of the words that were different in the two sentences.  If I could find examples of usage and ideally examples of it being used incorrectly that would help with my final answer a great deal.

I looked at truncated descriptions of ‘ku’ in the Google snippets I gathered that it was a ‘terminator’ or something to separate parts of a sentence in Lojban. This rang true with the AI explanation although the AI did not use this term. From the snippets I pulled up a ‘Lojban Cheatsheet’ (tmh.conlang.org/lojban/cheatsheet.html) to pick up some short cuts hopefully to Lojban grammar.

From the cheatsheet I could see there were references to putting Ku after le,lo and la but nothing after co’a  suggesting by default that it could be out of place as described by the AI.  This deduction was by no means definitive.

I tried – co’a ku lojban          then,  ‘co’a’+ lojban

I tried co’a ku without the inverted commas first just to see what came up. Nothing much useful came up so I narrowed the search by adding inverted commas.   If there were example of ‘co’a ku’ in sentences it might serve to refute the AI’s assertion that ku was out of place in the sentence structure of answer (B).  My only deduction was by default again that co’a and ku don’t have any instances of being put together in a phrase.

From the snippets I pulled up a site on Lojban basics (lojban.io/courses/introduction/3/) Found examples of ku in how it should be used which was nothing like option (B) but no examples of incorrect usage which would have been more useful.

I had more direct try at finding incorrect usage of ku with -  incorrect grammar Lojban + ‘co’a ku’

I couldn’t see anything from the snippets so I pulled up a book on Lojban(la-lojban.github.io…) I used the local search and used a search trick to zone in on what I wanted.  When doing searches in journals you can get a large quantity of search results because that combination of letters are in many words, so I just put spaces to the back and front of the word.  This worked fine for ‘ku’ or rather ‘ ku ’. I read more about the correct usage of ku and then moved onto another line of investigation with the time remaining.

I plugged in – ‘co’a lo’ + lojban grammar

This was from option (A) and described by the AI as correct usage. From the snippets I pulled up a rather extensive tome on Lojban Grammar  (theswissbay.ch/pdf/Books…..). 
In this pdf I tried -  co’a lo     and got nothing. 

Then I tried -  co’a      and got a few hits.   I did not find anything directly useful for making my choices of options.

I used the last few minutes with online translators. Using Stars21 (stars21.com/translator/lojban/english) I tried – co’a lo (from option(A))  and got ‘it’s starting’
I then tried – co’a ku (from option(B)) and got   ‘it started’. 

I had run out of time so I stopped the time.  I did not find anything to contradict the AI but this was more by what I didn’t find than what I did.  The AI explanation held together well based on my limited knowledge of Lojban, so I was reasonably confident that the AI had got it right and I pulled the slider up just a few more degrees for answer (A).

After reading the AI explanation I went with my standard level of confidence for the AI being usually correct.

After some online reading I was initially baffled as to why  intravenous erythromycin had been presented as an option that might challenge (A). However towards the end of the 20 minutes I was struck with a dilemma in that  intravenous erythromycin may be valid if the actual diagnosis was Pseudo-SBO here a real obstruction did not exist.  Add to this schizophrenia and the potential of anti-psychotic use which are massive confounding factors producing their own sets of gut problems that are not well characterized, then you have a very confusing picture.

I began my online investigations with copy and pasting the whole description into Chrome to see what Google produced with this.  For all I knew it could be some classic case.  Nothing much came out of that so I proceeded with looking up  unfamiliar terms.   I then continued to see if there was anything concerning with the bodily metrics.  There was not much to attract anything worth investigating with this.
 
I tried putting option (A) -  Intravenous erythromycin     into Chrome in isolation to see what it was known for. I gathered it was for treating infections. Then I added ‘side effects’ onto the search to see if anything useful came up.  Quite a few slightly serious side effects but nothing to attract my attention except that these side effects were  a good reason not to use it.

I tried -  Intravenous erythromycin and abdominal pain and vomiting

Unfortunately this search centred around the side effects of erythromycin. This which included both abdominal pain and vomiting  so I would speculate it would not be a great way to ease these symptoms.  Putting a tube down someone’s throat would hold mechanical risks but nothing like this.

I tried -  Intravenous erythromycin used today.

I was satisfied that it was still in  contemporary usage but nothing to suggest it was the best choice.

I moved my search to option (B) and put it into Chrome
 - Nasogastric tube decompression

Straight forward enough moving the contents of the stomach out through a tube.  I had underestimated the risk factors though  because the patient could die of vomiting or getting bits of matter or liquid stuck in the lungs. I pulled up an image from Google so I could visualise it better and dispel any flawed assumptions.

I shifted my search to schizophrenia and homelessness.  I couldn’t see how this might impact my choices.

I tried -  Schizophrenic homeless man abdominal pain and vomiting

I started getting search results linked to gut problems and schizophrenia and remembered I had come across this sometime and knew it was poorly researched but very significant regarding mental states.  I also read that this condition could induce many of the symptoms that I was seeing in the description.  Furthermore the trial description did not assert it was SBO, that was an assumption made by the AI.

I pulled up the journal from the top snippet.  Gastroenterology issues in schizophrenia: why the gut matters (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc….)  Anti-psychotics were mentioned and I began thinking about if the patient did not have SBO.

I put in – homelessness and drug use     to get a statistic on the proportion of homeless people involved in drug use which was high as expected.

I pulled up some symptoms from the question description and tried :

- homelessness and distended, tympanitic, diffusely tender abdomen + drug use

I speculated that the homelessness aspect could involve eating food from skips that held a  cocktail of undesirable bacteria.

As a wild card I tried – homelessness and fentanyl

Nothing particularly useful came up with this search although nausea and vomiting were mentioned as side effects.

I put the AI assumption into Chrome -  small bowel obstruction (SBO) 

I got predictable results and nothing much new so I tried - SBO (A) vs (B) :

- SBO  Intravenous erythromycin  vs Nasogastric tube decompression 

 For SBO option (B) was coming up from the snippets but I still had suspicions that SBO may be a false assumption. I pulled up a journal from the top snippet ‘Management of small bowel obstruction and systematic review of treatment without nasogastric tube decompression’  (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov….).  I gathered that option (B) was  standard practice but some patients rejected it because of the discomfort. 

I tried – symptoms of  SBO deceiving ‘not SBO’ 

I pulled up another journal ‘Bowel Obstruction...’ (m.clevelandclinic.org…)

I came across the term ‘pseudo-obstruction’ in there. Where you experience the symptoms of bowel obstruction, but it does not exist. Poorly researched.

I tried – ‘ pseudo SBO’

I found it was a genuine condition with almost the same symptoms and speculated that if no obstruction existed would a tube still be the best option ? This was the dilemma I found at the last moment. The snippet was from a respectable journal ‘Intestinal Pseudo Obstruction’ so I pulled it up. (ncbi.nlm.gov….) I gathered it was called Ogilvie Syndrome. I noticed option (B) was still suggested for early management which I did not see rationale for if nothing was there.

I gradually lost confidence in the AI answer (B) during the trial and that accounts my pulling the slider back a considerable amount.  I speculated that option (B) was standard practice but I had considerable doubts given that  we had a homeless schizophrenic which was going to ramp up the probability of the true condition being Pseudo-SBO and the best initial treatment something to reduce infection like option (A).

On first reading the trial I thought doing a CT scan would be best as a precaution. So (B) was my choice.

On reading the AI explanation I changed my view to (A)  because I hadn’t taken into account the health risks from radiation associated with Ct scans. However I was not extremely confident in the AI’s choice until I had investigated further.

I started my online search into Chrome with :   -  mass on the right side of his scrotum

I gathered from the top snippet from a respected source that it was usually benign and with an outside chance of cancer. Could be an indication of other conditions.   Would someone want something like that hanging out of them ?

- I pulled up the site from Cleveland Clinic (my.clevelandclinic.org…) I read through the article.

I added : - and Ct scan     to the end of the last search.

From the snippets on the top page of Google I pulled up a page that mentioned Ct scans from the Mayo Clinic (mayoclinic.org…).  I saw that there were an array of tests to do before a Ct scan was considered necessary.  This indicated to me that a Ct scan would only be necessary if there were indications from the other safer tests.

I felt I already had what I needed, which would be a high confidence in option (A) in congruence with the AI explanation. I continued just in case I had missed something.

I tried:  - scrotal mass when Ct scan justified

I pulled up a site from the top snippet  ‘Imaging Testicular and Scrotal Masses...’ (ncbi.nlm.gov….)
I gathered that radiologists are reluctant to do scrotum scans because  the scans are confusing to characterise.  In the journal there were outlines of  symptoms  that would be a cause for concern.
I flicked through them and almost nothing aligned with the trial description of our patient. The only outlier was  if the growth had an irregular shape.  A ‘bags of worms’ texture from the question description would qualify as irregular I would imagine.

I continued with this line of investigation in Chrome : -   scrotal mass  ‘bags of worms’ texture

 Varicocele was highlighted in the top snippet which aligns with this texture and was suggested by the AI.  The source was ‘Men’s Health’ (menshealth,com….) which I am not 100% confident in  but I pulled it up anyway. I was happy to accept the Men’s Health layman’s description of varicocele, if little else.   Varicoceles can be bad news for fertility I gathered, so that could be a reason to go further with tests and surgery I speculated.

I tried: - scrotal mass varicocele
Read the top description on the top snippet for background (Mayo Clinic).  I then added to the search with:

- right side + ‘when Ct’

What I was looking for were further examples of when it would be a good chioce to do a Ct scan. I already had descriptions of red flags from previous searches which did not align with any good reasons to do Ct scans with our cab driver. I was just making sure I had not missed anything.  From the top snippet from Midwest Institute I got the ‘watchful waiting’  suggestion again in congruence with the AI choice of options (A). I pulled up the article and did not see anything to refute the Ai’s choice.

I tried a further search in Chrome: - scrotal mass distinct from the testicle and epididymis.
I did see anything useful I did not already know now.

I added : - varicocele + no pain+    to the beginning of the previous search
I pulled up another article by the Mayo Clinic which discussed  varicoceles as the main topic. I pulled up another article about varicoceles from the Cleveland clinic.  

By this point I felt like I had read enough to have a very high confidence in answer (A) in congruence with the AI and so I stopped the timer a few minutes early.

Firstly the case was very  long and convoluted, it looked like something our current generation of AI’s could get lost in.

I put the slider up a few more degrees against the AI’s choice.

The Ai had made asserted a number of points.  All the arguments but one seemed reasonable to me which I attributed to the AI’s getting overwhelmed with all the details and becoming ‘sketchy’ which I have seen before in my daily activities.  I decided to concentrate on this aspect mainly during my online searches.

I began my online search with :

- wills + verbal consent      then added:    + ‘us law’

I was getting frustrated with Uk hits which are not useful here.  With hindsight I would have switched on my VPN and found a US server but in honesty this finesse did not occur to me and I was mindful of the timer running.  Unravelling the key features of this detailed case took a sizeable portion of the time available.

I changed my search to -  wills + verbal consent  + ‘american law’
I gathered that most wills needed to be executed in writing with two witnesses. 

I looked in the ‘People also ask’ section and there were one or two sections that looked like they could be useful like such as ‘is verbal consent acceptable’.  I continued down the page and found a useful looking snippet. I continued to pull up the ‘AllLaw’  website (alllaw.com…) It suggested that oral wills typically don’t work. Also in most states it has to be in writing.

I refined the terms of my search: - verbal agreement after death + ‘american law’

A snippet was stating almost all contracts were still valid after death.   I was already familiar with contracts continuing after  death and really wanted something closer to my case. 

  Further snippets continued to emphasise that verbal contracts are very difficult to enforce after death and this was supporting my choice of (A).

I tried  - ‘unfinished verbal promises after death’ + ‘american law’

I had satisfied myself that as far as I could ascertain in the time available that the first AI assertion would not hold.  I moved on to the last assertion from the AI, that just because the executor turned down the student’s claim did not have  any bearing in a court and furthermore a challenge in the courts could still be made.

I tried:  - claim denied by the executor + ‘american law’
I pulled up a snippet ‘Executor mishandling….’ (hchlawyers.com…)  I did not see anything I could use.

I had spend time in the other trials looking at Lojban and had got some understanding of ‘ku’.  My decision was not a technical one, option (A)  just seemed to look right. 

I spent time trying really working with the AI explanation and I felt like it made sense to me, in that the first sentence was separated in the right way so my initial intuition seemed vindicated. 

I don’t think the internet search really helped that much on this occasion.  I could get translations of certain words without any problem but the trial was much subtler than that and the translators were a long way from making sense of full phrases. If the translators were not thinking in Lojban they would get nowhere for instance ‘cmoni’ could mean tweet, bark or neigh depending on the creature which whilst elegant, could be confusing for a translator.

On other projects when I had come across a fairly obscure phrase or word spelling, and physical dictionaries were becoming difficult (with taxonomy for instance) I often used a technique where the spelling that got the most hits  was often often the most dominant one. I cannot say this shortcut worked with Lojban.  My thinking was that if there were phases in common usage in the Lojban community there would be examples,  and word combinations that did not work so well there would be much less hits or none at all.  Normally this kind technique worked well for a host of topics but only marginally with Lojban I found. It worked with two words at a time but for both correct and possibly incorrect word combinations.  Maybe if correct usage  becomes more widespread from its connection with AI this may change.

I began by looking up a few words and word combinations in ‘vlasisku.lojban...’ which  I find is one of the better translators online. ‘ co’u ’ was congruent with the AI explanation but it stopped short with longer combinations such as ‘ co’u ku ‘ from option (A). 

I tried: -  ‘lo nu ’    from option (B) on the same site and came up with a translation that was congruent with the AI description.  I did this with a number of others words in option (A) and (B) and they were all congruent with the AI description.  If the AI was going to make a mistake with this trial I speculated it was more likely in the grammar and overall meanings of each sentence which was much harder to assess without a deeper understanding of Lojban grammar.

I  put a shorter extract of option (B) into Chrome – co’u lo nu    The extract came up in an obscure site with a post from 2010. I was not familiar with it, Tatoeba (tatoeba.org/en….) . I pulled it up.  It had a  translator.  I put in the whole of option (A) and got nothing. I tried ‘cmoni’ and got numerous examples but I was already familiar with the different meanings of this word for different creatures which I understood as a feature of Lojban.  I tried an English-Lojban translation putting in the whole phase from the trial and got nothing.
 
 I decided to try another translator. Into Chrome : Lojban translator
I pulled up a main Lojban site just titled ‘Lojban’ on that page (mw.lojban.org…) then moved to another site. I pulled up ‘Stars21’ (stars21.com/translator…).  I tried an extract of the English in the trial: 

- it was quiet until        got a Lojban translation that was slightly different to options (A) and (B) with a number of the same words, which got me nowhere.

I tried putting into Chrome: -   co’u lo nu      and pulled up a Wikipedia site (en.wiktionary.org/wiki….) 
Using option (B) :   -    co’u which had examples which included:   co’u lo nu    So apparently it was acceptable to use this combination of words.

I tried a longer extracts in option (B) in Chrome: - ‘smaji co’u lo nu’    That combination of words was not presented in Google, just stray words or pairs of words.

I tried a longer extract from option (A) - ‘smaji co’u ku’ lojban    and nothing useful.

I had run out of time. On this occasion I brought the slider back slightly because if anything my searches supported option (B), but it was very inconclusive.

My impression of the fifth  was that in any case criminal or civil case a person could bail out at any moment by pleading the fifth.  

On reading the AI explanation and choice of (B) I just could not buy it.  I suspected the AI was reeling out plausible untruths.  Therefore I discounted it and stayed with my original confidence levels.

After my online research I had found pretty clear evidence that my initial view was incorrect in this case and I shifted view in support of the AI’s choice of (B) with a high level of confidence.

I began my online search with: - fifth amendment + self-incrimination
The top snippet reeled off  the well known material I already knew,  de facto knowledge.  Paraphrasing – you don’t have to testify if it incriminates you, you can plead the fifth…

I pulled up a post from the snippet from the Cornell Law School (law.cornell.edu...) which seemed to occupy quite a prominent position online judging from my searches.  I found a part which stated that the moment the witness takes the stand or says something self-incriminating when asked specific questions  they waive the fifth. This supported (B) congruent with the AI answer in clear terms. 

I scrolled down to the ‘People also Ask’ section of Google search and found ‘What is the fifth amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination’  The snippet from Practical Law (uk.practicallaw…)  was the a repeat of the fifth. I pulled up the site to investigate further .  It was a Uk site, but they were discussing US law. They appearing to support option (A) but did not go into enough details.

In Chrome I tried :  - fifth amendment + ‘avoid self-incrimination’      
I saw mention of  the ‘Miranda v’ case in the snippet which it labelled as  a landmark  case in this area. The rest of the snippet was just another re-iteration of the main gist of the fifth.

I added ‘waiver’ and tweaked the search a little : -  ‘waiver fifth amendment’ + self-incrimination 
I found something useful in the top snippet from SMU scholar ‘waiver the fifth: What level of incrimination….’ .         This was discussing that once the witness had answered an incriminating question he/she loses the option to plead the fifth on related questions. It also stated that what determines the waiver is if it was sufficiently incriminating to qualify.  

 I pulled up the PDF, looking through the pages it was a monograph on the area I needed to look into.   I gathered the authors of this account discussed the fifth in terms of ‘privilege’  and two situations characterised the confusion and debate (pp.2). 

One is when the witness is asked a potentially incriminating question and the witness has the choice of answering or refusing. This is where the issue of how incriminating the answer would need to be for the fifth to be claimed.

 The second situation occurs when the witness has decided to answer the question. As far as I can see just the act of walking into the witness box is an admission to answer the question and waiver the fifth (pp.15 and 20).   If she wanted to plead the fifth she would have needed to do it earlier.   This appeared to be confirmed in a very expansive way in the law journal (SMU)  and in a more distilled form in the  Cornell Law article.

The extended discussion on this legal dilemma was very  convoluted so there is no way I can be 100% on this without spending all day reading, but from what I had found online I am highly confident in favour of (B) in agreement with the AI.
",A,60.0,40.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Validate it, given that the right against self-incrimination is applicable in both civil and criminal proceedings.): 60%; B (Disallow it, on the grounds that the woman relinquished this right by choosing to testify voluntarily.): 40%",60.0,40.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Validate it, given that the right against self-incrimination is applicable in both civil and criminal proceedings.): 60%; B (Disallow it, on the grounds that the woman relinquished this right by choosing to testify voluntarily.): 40%",On reading the AI explanation and choice of (B) I just could not buy it.

I was not going into this trial completely blind because I had spent time only the day before working on the fifth in a previous trial, so I had a head start.  I already knew that defendant B could remain silent and that silence should not be construed as an admission of guilt.  This looked too easy to me so I was looking for a nuance in some part of the case to make matters more finely balanced.

 The AI choice of (B) served to reinforce my confidence in this choice. I pulled the slider much higher than my statistical estimation of the AI being usually correct.  Much of the explanation confirmed my own understanding of the fifth but I needed to look into the hearsay rule a little more.

I began my online search with:  Miranda rule + ‘us law’
From the top snippet (Cornell Law) Right to remain silent… et cetera.  Knew this by heart from popular TV.  I continued to pull up the article (law.cornell.edu...) and reminded myself of some of the finer details.

I continued with : ‘us law’+ ‘arrestee A accuses B’+ fifth
This was rather clumsy but at that moment I could not think of a better way of putting it hoping Google search would find its way towards something I could use. From the top snippet I pulled up another article from Cornell on the fifth (law.cornell.edu.fifth_amendment) At this point the timer reset itself on its own volition, but it did not matter because I had timer on the screen recorder. Only drawback was that it did not have an alarm feature which I was finding useful.  
  I read in this site that in some instances silence can be deemed an admission of guilt.  This contradicted my understanding of the fifth and cast some doubt on my choice of (B).  I hoped to try and find which instances at some point in this trial.

I tried: - confession + hearsay rule + ‘us law’     I gathered from the top snippet there were two tests in order to allow hearsay as  admissible against a criminal defendant (Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980):

1. The declarant had to be unavailable.
2. Have to make the statement in circumstances that indicate it is trustworthy and credible in order to be reliable.

Our case falls down on both counts in that the declarant was available and the evidence was unreliable because it was coming from someone who had been arrested and  may have been lying to protect there own interests. This snippet was from Wikipedia which is good but not the best. I scrolled down ‘People also ask’ to find a better source.  I pulled up the Cornell article on hearsay (law.cornell.edu/wex/hearsay…)  I did not find anything particularly useful.

I tried: -  ‘right to remain silent’+ ‘us law’     In the snippets there did appear to be some examples of cases where the defendant’s right to remain silent was used against them, which seemed contradictory to me.

I added: -   + ‘admission of guilt’             to the end of the previous search.  I gathered from a snippet that if a defendant is on the stand and is accused of something then goes silent this could be construed as admission of guilt.  Regarding our silent defendant this was not applicable because the circumstances were different since  he was silent throughout.  This bolstered my confidence further in favour of (B).

Scrolling down to the FindLaw site (findlaw.com/criminal...) I could see a potential problem with choice of (B),  that the accused defendants testimony was ‘impermissible’.  This site emphasised that the defendant has to be very explicit in invoking the fifth which infers that our defendant B may not be covered unless he or his solicitor expresses it in a very direct way.  However,  according to this site a defendant has to waive his right to the fifth also.   He could do this by speaking, which our defendant did not do. 
  In clarification on this same site it states that prosecutors are not permitted to attribute guilt by a defendants silence but it is still possible that a jury might.  

I followed the link ‘self-incrimination’            I got to  ‘Fifth Amendment Protection Against Self-Incrimination’      (constitution.findlaw.com/amendment5/annotation04.html)  This site went over a variety of cases and was something of a monograph on self-incrimination.  It didn’t give me anything more that I had not already worked through earlier.

I tried:  -  ‘silent but did not call the fifth’ and then added + ‘us law’
I clicked on the top site, MoloLamken LLP (mololamken.com…)  This site did not give me anything useful and from my recent knowledge of the fifth it had errors.

Going over everything the choice I had made was certainly not as clear cut as I first thought but I had by this point got enough knowledge to go confidently with the AI in support of (B).


",B,25.0,75.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Permissible as evidence, on the grounds that a confession from one participant in a crime is legally admissible against the other participant.): 25%; B (Impermissible as evidence, given the situation, there was no duty or obligation for accused B to respond to the accusations.): 75%",6.0,94.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Permissible as evidence, on the grounds that a confession from one participant in a crime is legally admissible against the other participant.): 6%; B (Impermissible as evidence, given the situation, there was no duty or obligation for accused B to respond to the accusations.): 94%",The AI choice of (B) served to reinforce my confidence in this choice.

I had come across some US contract law in a previous trial and the written offer with a written acceptance looked like a valid contract to me.  The leasehold argument in option (B) did not seem relevant.

After reading the AI explanation and choice of (A) this concurred with my choice and I was very confident.  

I began my online search with  ‘contract law’ +‘written offer’ + ‘was accepted’ + renague+‘us law’
Google helped me change the Uk English ‘renague’  to American English altering to ‘renege’ this would help me get more American hits.

I scrolled down the snippets pulled up the CFI article ‘Reneging’ (corporatefinanceinstitute.com...)
I gather from this account discussing contract law that if the uncle is still within the 72 hours cooling off period he could renague without getting sued.  Not sure if this aspect of the law applies in this particular case.  
Just for the sake of discussion since the Uncle sent the offer by letter and the nephew returned her acceptance by letter it may be over the 72 hours from the time going through the postal system.  However there is no indication of this in the question so it is conceivable that the uncle is within the 72 hours cooling off period and safe from being sued. However option (B) would still be invalid so we would be left with two invalid options. I can only presume we are the past 72 hours cooling off period to continue.

 Looking through the current batch of snippets there were mentions of ‘compelling ground to renege’.  More reading would be needed, but our case did not appear to have any such compelling grounds. 

I attempted a ‘long shot’ zoning in tightly on antique businesses.  There was a good chance that my search would be too narrow to bear useful results here:

I tried : - antiques business + ‘contract law’ +‘written offer’ + ‘was accepted’ + renege+‘us law’
I scrolled down the snippets and pulled up an article by USlegal on Contract Law (business.uslegal.com/contract-law/).  This site began by describing key features of written contracts I was already acquainted with.  Namely the offer in writing, ‘consideration’ - financial offer in this case, then there has to be acceptance by the other party.

Mutual agreement needed all in writing.  Going back to our previous discussion of what might make the uncle’s offer invalid this article described some examples.  Paraphrasing if he wrote the letter offering the business at gunpoint, or had just been sectioned.  These circumstances would make an arguable case. This could make the contract ‘voidable’.  From the question description no such circumstance existed so the case was not voidable.  

There was also mention of ‘intent’ if the offer was made as a joke, it could be invalid.  Our offer was sent in writing without any humour as far as can be discerned.  From the perspective of a reasonable person this cannot be a valid argument.  The article continued to discuss  areas not valid to our case.  There  was mention of the ‘mailbox rule’ in that the letter of acceptance has to be deemed to be received.  This was affirmative in our case.

If the nephew was under 21 (some states 18 years) the uncle could argue that his nephew lacked ‘contractual capacity’ and did not know what his nephew was getting into and for his own good the uncle felt he had to renege. I did not have any information regarding the nephews age and in any event such a circumstance appears rather contrived.

I tried: - ‘us law’ + ‘buy retail business’ + ‘breach of contract’ + ‘offer in writing’ 
I thought to add retail business rather than ‘antiques business’ to have more chance of getting relevant hits.  I pulled up a site by Hanon Neighman & Wright (hnwlaw.com...)  that was more specific to my case but I did not see anything further that I needed.

I had enough to inform my choice but I continued just to see if I had missed anything.  In the last few minutes I decided to try and find a monograph on this area of law adding: 

pdf+‘us law’ + ‘buy retail business’ + ‘breach of contract’ + ‘offer in writing’ 
After scrolling through the snippets I pulled up a site by the Judicial Branch of California (selfhelp.courts.ca.gov….) It was just a re-iteration of material I was already aware of.

I tried  : - contract + ‘us law’ + ‘offer in writing’
I pulled up an article by FindLaw (findlaw.com/smallbusiness…) ‘What contracts are required to be in writing?’ I did not learn anything new.

I tried  : - contract + ‘us law’ + ‘offer in writing’ + retail

On first reading I went with (A) with no great amount of confidence. I had a slight concern with the sentence structure and use of misleading pronouns.  I speculated that this could be a confounding factor with the AI’s choice and explanation.

 ‘the respondent wishes to introduce evidence demonstrating that the expert witness had previously submitted false testimony during HIS personal marital dissolution proceedings.’  This is ambiguous and could refer to either respondent or expert witness.


On reading the AI explanation I changed my view towards (B) concurring with the AI.  It looked plausible but I would have to check the details. 
 It was  concerning  me that option (B) did not fit well with the issue in the question with the respondent wanting to add evidence to discredit the expert witness, which could fall into the category of ‘extrinsic evidence’ and not be allowed. Option (B) seemed to be answering a different question.

I began my online research on Chrome with :  ‘expert witness’ + Rule 608(b) + ‘false testimony’  

I gathered from the top snippet that it was permitted to look into an expert witness’s misconduct on the stand, in order to attack his/her credibility if it helps to prove his/her level of truthfulness.  

From the snippets I pulled up an article from The University of Chicago ‘Proving Corruption: Extrinsic Evidence of Uncharged Perjury’ (lawreview.uchicago.edu….)
Describes exceptions to extrinsic evidence and ‘bad acts’ are permitted to be proved under cross-examination because witness statements are not extrinsic evidence.  I gathered that the point of restricting certain testimonies was to prevent a waste of the courts time effectively making  a trial within a trial. 

I pulled up the article from the top snippet of the same search from Cornell Law School: ‘Rule 608. A Witness’s Character for Truthfulness or Untruthfulness’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_608#….)

Extrapolating narrowly from the trial question the respondent wants to call the expert witness and wants him to be cross-examined in such a way that the expert witness damns himself because of the his past false testimony.

According to various cases described in this accounts eg. Mc Mormick,49: pp.105   Attacks to establish untruthfulness of a witness were admitted, as long as it was direct or the ‘extrinsic evidence’ rules could be in enacted.

I tried: - ‘alleged violation of a  violation of a business agreement’ + ‘previous false testimony’ + ‘expert witness’ (too much Uk)  then I added to the beginning: -  ‘us law’ +

From the top snippet I pulled up the article from Cornell Law School ‘Rule 702: Testimony by Expert Witness’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_702)

It went into what an expert witness can discuss and how to assess the validity of his/her testimony. The account did not engage with undermining the expert witness with regards to truthfulness or false testimony. For my trial question I surmised that is was not necessary to get involved in that level of detail in this particular subset of law  so the article was not useful. 

Scrolling down the snippets I pulled up from Cornell Law School  ‘Credible Witness’ ( https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/credible_witness )  

 This listed six ways to prove a witness was not credible.  Number 2 on this list ‘ reputation for untruthfulness’ corresponded with the trial question that the respondent wanted to establish that the expert witness made previous false statements. 

From the snippets I pulled up an article by the Expert Institute ‘False Expert Statements: Legal Consequences for Expert Witnesses and Attorneys’ (expertinstitute.com/resources/insights/false…)

It gave some background information on the potential legal consequences for false testimony from expert witnesses. I gathered actual legal action against them was very rare.  It did not offer me any further useful insight towards my case.

By this point I noticed that the timer had run down but not gone off and the Modulo questions page had reset itself so I went back and returned the sliders to their original places finally adding a high level of confidence towards (B) concurring with the AI.",B,60.0,40.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Omitted, as it constitutes inappropriate character evidence.): 60%; B (Admitted, but only if itâ€™s obtained from the expert witness during cross examination.): 40%",25.0,75.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Omitted, as it constitutes inappropriate character evidence.): 25%; B (Admitted, but only if itâ€™s obtained from the expert witness during cross examination.): 75%","On reading the AI explanation I changed my view towards (B) concurring with the AI.

Furthermore  in option (B) I could not understand what ‘disadvantage’ could be referring to.

On reading the AI choice it concurred with my own.  The explanation looked plausible and now I understood what was meant by ‘disadvantage’.  Option (A) still looked the best and I was quite confident.

I began my online research in Chrome with: - ‘sharp practice’ + ‘implied-in-fact’ + ‘implied contract’
Looking at the top snippet (Cornell Law) it concurred with  the AI explanation. I proceeded to pull up the article ‘contract implied in fact’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/contract_implied_in_fact…)  The short account concurred with the AI explanation. 

I followed a link on this site ‘express contracts’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/express_contract)

 From reading the description I did not think that the case in our trail was like this because there was no explicit written or oral contract, so that kind of contract could be discounted from my investigations.  
   I was of a mind that we were indeed considering an implied contract. For instance when you buy an ice cream cornet from a van you expect to pay.  The client could have been naïve or she could have just changed her mind regarding the yacht and just not wanted to pay. 

I clicked back to the ‘contract implied in fact’ article and clicked on the ‘implied in law’ article
(law.cornell.edu/wex/contract_implied_in_fact) 

Apparently from this account  this was equivalent to a ‘constructive contract’ According to the case sited (Bailey v. West) for such a contract to exist amongst other features there had to be a ‘benefit’ and there did not appear to be a benefit for the client because she had decided not to buy the yacht.  

There was  at some point in time when she wanted the answer so it would have been reasonable to expect a charge, but it would also seem reasonable if their was a charge  for  the lawyer to contact the client give him a quote rather than just going ahead and doing the work.  This concurred with the AI descriptions highlighting the weaknesses in option (B).

To be a constructive contract there was also the feature of acceptance and retention by the client. Clearly there was no acceptance from the client.  There was also mention of ‘appreciation’ by the client.  This was clearly not the case.   All this looked rather dubious but legal, that the client was getting this bill.  This led me to think it was ‘sharp practice’.

I clicked back to the original search: - ‘sharp practice’ + ‘implied-in-fact’ + ‘implied contract’
I was surprise that there was so few hits regarding ‘sharp practice’. This seems a little suspect to me and with hindsight I would have used another browser. Maybe for some inscrutable algorithmic reason Google was suppressing certain useful results.

I tried: ‘unethical’ ‘implied-in-fact’ + ‘implied contract’   
      
I flicked through the short definitions in the People Also Ask section.  One of the snippets described a circumstance where the client-professional relationship has broken down and described in this context the ‘implied’ meant reflecting the intentions when the implied contract was developed. 

The snippets continued with making distinctions between quasi contracts and implied contracts.  I cannot suggest that I found this particularly useful to me.

I simplified my search with: - ‘unethical’ + ‘implied-in-fact’
Now my search was too broad.  I got hits for ‘unethical’ but not for the topic area I needed.

I tried: - ‘unethical’ + ‘implied contract’        

This search brought me to a snippet describing ‘unconscionable contracts’ which it described as unjust where one party had considerably more bargaining power.  With our case it was true to suggest that the lawyer had considerably more bargaining power because he  chose what to charge but this case looks more like a breakdown in communication rather than ‘unconscionable practice’.  Maybe if the lawyer had charged $50,000 it would be that. Plus the question did state it was a reasonable price for this service.  

In the other option there was mention of being ‘disadvantaged’ I understood this to mean the time and effort the lawyer expended in assessing the yacht contract and writing an A4 response. The solicitor should have been aware of the legal status of his actions and it would at least have been good manners to attempt some confirmation. I concurred with the AI that this defence would be unlikely to play out well in court. 

I added: - + ‘us law’ 	                      to the end of the last search

I did not see anything promising enough for the snippets on the first page so I continued with the second.

I found that the Modulo questions page had reset itself so I quickly restored the sliders back to their previous places.

I tried: -  ‘unethical’ + ‘implied-in-fact’+ ‘us law’ + ‘unfair bill’

I saw that the timer had reset itself but I continued with reference to the timer on my screen recorder. I was at the end of my 20 minutes so I closed the search and proceeded to move the slider to a high confidence in option (B) concurring with the AI.

I began my online research looking up some terms.

I put into Chrome: - property warranties  define		then +‘us law’

I was only really clear on warranties in regard to retail products.  In the context of property it appeared to be some kind of assurance that facts about a property are true.

I put into Chrome: -  estopped define			then +‘us law’ 

I had seen the term in passing from these trials but I did not have a good understanding of it. I gathered that in a legal sense, which is the only sense I think existed, that it stops someone going back on something they have committed to previously.

It was difficult to see a way through this case. In Chrome I tried : 

-  quitclaim deed + ‘false premise’ + ‘us law’

From the snippets I pulled up the article ‘How to deal with Quitclaim deed fraud’ (schorr-law.com/quitclaim-deed-fraud/)

I had taken the AI definition of quitclaims as valid so saved time confirming it online. I did not think that this was a fraud case I just wanted to get some understanding of the dynamics and key features of quitclaims.  I gathered  a quitclaim deed can applied for by a fraudster to build the appearance legitimacy in property ownership. 

From the snippets I pulled up ‘Consequences of an improper quitclaim deed’ (korshaklaw.com/blog/2021/10/consequences….)

This was getting closer to what I needed with our case.  Was our quitclaim deed improper ? 
From this site I understood that quitclaim deeds could be used to record that someone has no longer has any links to a property and additionally you could add someone else to the property title.  In our case Zoey transferred her interest in the orchard to Xaxier which turned out to be precisely zero. 

Continuing with this article I gathered that quitclaim deeds are made sometimes when the title status is uncertain.  This would apply to our case because claims to the orchard were disputed.  Xavier was aware that the twins were bickering but apparently not enough to show bad faith.  If he had been privy to more details of the dispute between Zoey and Zane a case involving bad faith could have been made.  
  With regards to option (A) Zoey’s claim to the orchard with peremptory and would invalidate Zoey’s contract when it had been established that Zoey had no claim to the orchard.   Another interesting aspect of quitclaim deeds are that generally they do not involve money changing hands between the involved parties.  This was not the case in that $1500 was passed to Zoey which maybe indicates something going on that is questionable.

From this site I clicked on the link: - ‘repercussions of a quitclaim deed’ (korshaklaw.com/real-estate-litigation/)  This link led to a plug for this company and was not relevant or useful.

I continued with: -  ‘initial payment’ + estopped + ‘us law’

Scrolling down  there was a snippet from The International Journal of Business and Social Science.  This suggested that promissory estoppel was best used for defence not attack.  This cast quite some further uncertainty on option (B) since Zoey was making a claims against Xavier based upon tools used primarily for defence.

Then I tried: - ‘initial payment’ + estopped + ‘us law’ + probate
Google sent me down the wrong track not recognising ‘estoppel’ and re-interpreting as ‘stopped’

I added to the end of the previous search : -    + cornell 
From the top snippet I pulled up the Cornell article on Probate (law.cornell.edu.wex.probate)

I saw that my time was up so I briefly flicked down a few more snippets then went to the questions page.  I did not move the slider from my original place of 60% towards (B).  I think option (B) just tipped the scales in its favour because option (A) was more clearly wrong.

 





",A,50.0,50.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (prevail, due to the fact that Xavier deliberately negotiated and procured a quitclaim deed from Zoey in anticipation of securing the apple orchard.): 50%; B (emerge victorious, as Xavier, by offering the initial $1,500 payment, is estopped from renouncing the validity of his contractual agreement with Zoey.): 50%",40.0,60.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (prevail, due to the fact that Xavier deliberately negotiated and procured a quitclaim deed from Zoey in anticipation of securing the apple orchard.): 40%; B (emerge victorious, as Xavier, by offering the initial $1,500 payment, is estopped from renouncing the validity of his contractual agreement with Zoey.): 60%",On reading the AI explanation and choice I was not greatly confident in the choice of (B). Furthermore I was highly confident that there was not a good answer in the choices offered. It appeared it was a choice of which one was less worse rather than correct.,
2024-08-13 18:27:57.459,QPDJR,31,,,,On my first reading I had no idea what the correct answer was.,96,4,After my research: A (Diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema): 96%; B (Double bubble sign): 4%,A,"On my first reading I had no idea what the correct answer was.

On reading the AI explanation and choice I was more confident that the correct answer was (A).  In option (B) there was no clear diagnosis because according to the AI a double bubble sign is typical of the duodenal atresia but this not followed by typical symptoms such as the inability to feed or vomiting.   Breathing problems are indicated which I surmise are anomalous to this condition. So there is something wrong here that had not been discovered.

I began my internet search in Chrome with : -   ‘Double bubble sign’ + diagnosis

The top snippet from National Institute of Health (NIH) confirmed the AI was correct in suggesting duodenal atresia was associated with the  X-ray showing the double bubble sign.

Scrolling down further I saw an image of the double bubble.  

I pulled up what looked like a monograph from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) titled ‘Respiratory Distress in the Newborn’ (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4533247/)

Understandably I gathered that cyanosis (blue hues) was related to oxygen deficiency in the affected area. Looking at diagnosis there was mention of cardiovascular disease being difficult to differentiate from pulmonary causes.  They also suggested the notion of timing describing how it may take time to become noticeable. I speculated if this could be the root of the confusion regarding no clear description by the AI of the condition when considering option (B). 

I put into Chrome : -  subcostal retractions and breathing

I understood from the snippet from the Cleveland Clinic that subcostal retractions was pushing the stomach up into the rib cage when breathing in.

I put into Chrome: -   moderate perioral cyanosis

I gathered from the NLM snippet that perioral meant the blue was around the hands, fingertips and toes.  I pulled up the full article ‘Central and Peripheral Cyanosis’ (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK559167/)

I gathered that cyanosis could be caused by pulmonary conditions. A large part of this technical article was characterising different oxygen level profiles, I did not think I needed to go into that level of detail to find my answers. 

I tried: - ‘Diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema’ and diagnosis

I gathered from the top snippet (Penn Medicine) that diagnosis did not appear surgical or minimally so.  I pulled up the article  ‘Interstitial Lung Disease Diagnosis’

(pennmedicine.org/for-patien…)   Diagnosis was around 95% non-surgical with only one procedure than was surgical at the end if a larger sample of lung was needed. Their policy was to use the least invasive method.

I tried: - ‘pulmonary interstitial edema’ and diagnosis’

I pulled up an article from the Mayo Clinic ‘Pulmonary edema – Diagnosis and treatment’
(mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/pulmonary-edema…) Regarding diagnosis there was no mention of surgery.

I put into Chrome: -  ‘Double bubble sign’ + diagnosis
I noticed that the top snippet mentioned  duodenal atresia concurring with the AI explanation.

I scrolled through the snippets and pulled up an article from the Cleveland Clinic ‘Duodenal Atresia’
 (my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/.)  This was mentioned by the AI as not the likely condition because there was no digestive problems such as vomiting or not wanted to feed. I thought I would just check diagnosis while I was here and it did not indicate any surgery.

I tried: -  ‘Double bubble sign’ + ‘difficulty breathing’    and got back to something I had previously read

I tried: - ‘subcostal retractions’ and ‘moderate perioral cyanosis’
The top snippet had  a case study held many similarities with our case

I added to the beginning of the search: - ‘breathing difficulties’ and got the same snippet so I pulled up the article from the NIH, ‘Respiratory Distress in the Newborn’
(ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4533247/) I found I had already looking through this journal previously and had turned full circle.

My time was up so I put the slider to concur with the AI and a high confidence in option (A).

Option (B) Incapacity could clearly be established and this would make the contract invalid.
Option (A) could go astray because oral contracts are valid in US law.  Enforcing it would be a different matter.

On reading the AI explanation I was still extremely confident the AI explanation did not make any difference to my confidence level in (B).

I did notice something that the AI overlooked in that the trial description stated   ‘discovered the agreement’ this rather indicated that there was some kind of written agreement and could make option (A) irrelevant depending on what was there.   Otherwise the AI concurred with my own understanding of this matter.

I began online with: - ‘us law’ + incapacity + voidable
Top snippet from Cornell titled ‘Incompetency’ stated that a contract with someone who was incompetent was voidable.

I added: -  ‘us law’ + incapacity + voidable + ‘pain killers’		attempting to narrow my search towards the case. 

I pulled up an article from Cornell titled ‘Voidable’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/voidable) That article did not quite have what I needed. 

I added:  +cornell  to the end of the search then changed the search around because I was getting the same results.

I tried: - ‘us law’ + ‘contract law’ incapacity + ‘pain killers’ + cornell

I pulled up the Cornell Law article on ‘Incompetency’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/incompetency)
The article described a lack of physical or intellectual ability. I went to the contract law part of the article.  Offers can be terminated because of the incapacity of the person before acceptance.

I looked through some snippets ‘People also ask’  and found similar confirmations in support of (B)
I came back to the Incompetency article and viewed the ‘Termination of Offer’  which re-iterated that incapacity was a valid defence especially under these circumstances because the lady had just had an accident and come out of hospital. It went on to state that a contract with someone who was incompetent was voidable.

I put extracts from option (A) into chrome: - ‘us law’ + ‘contract law’+ oral

I pulled up the article ‘Oral Contract’ from Cornell Law (law.cornell.edu/wex/oral_contract) 

The article continued to confirm that oral contracts could be valid. It also stated that some contracts could fail according to the Statue of Frauds.

It was a digression but I thought it should be valid in the US so I finished with a check : - ‘car sale’ + ‘us law’ + cooling off period    

According to the Federal Trade Commission there was a 3 days cooling off period and our senior citizen was within that period, so that sealed the matter there was no way the offeree was going enforce his contract legally.  

Most of the trials have been challenging so this trial was a gift although I expect if I had not done the previous trails it would have been just as difficult. I could not put the slider any further up in confidence for option (B).

2024-08-14 13:56:32.415,QPDJR,33,,,,On first reading the trial I was somewhat confident that the answer was (A).  I had come across ‘undue influence’ in previous trials but I was not so familiar with ‘insufficient consideration’ although I understood the term.,99,1,After my research: A (Undue influence.): 99%; B (Insufficient consideration.): 1%,A,"On first reading the trial I was somewhat confident that the answer was (A).  I had come across ‘undue influence’ in previous trials but I was not so familiar with ‘insufficient consideration’ although I understood the term.

On reading the AI explanation and choice the AI concurred with my understanding of our case and filled some of the details. I was even more confident that my choice of (A) was correct.

I began my online research in Chrome with: 

 - ‘insufficient consideration’ vs ‘undue influence’ + ‘us law’

It was telling that all the snippets were discussing ‘undue influence’ and not ‘insufficient consideration’. This was a crude rule of thumb but it indicated that the most dominant interest online in this area was with regards to ‘undue influence’.  

From the top snippet I pulled up an article by the American Bar Association (AMA) ‘Defining Undue Influence’ (americanbar.org/groups/law_aging/publications/bifocal/vol_35/issue_3_feb2014/defining_undue_influence/)

I was familiar with this term and it was certainly valid in our case with the daughter’s unconscionable actions.  What I really needed to confirm was what would be  the most appropriate basis that the Will could be invalidated.  I was looking through the articles with this frame of reference. This accounts for why I put  ‘insufficient consideration’ vs ‘undue influence’ . I was not so concerned with seeking definitions.

I understood from the article that there was a ‘new’ (01/01/2014)  law which outlines four metrics for ‘undue influence’ to be valid, the daughter scored well in every one.

1. Vulnerability.  Her late mother was on her death bed.

2.  Influencer’s apparent authority.  The influencer was her daughter who provided support and company  whilst the late mother’s son was distant.

3. Evidence of Tactics. This had three parts - Controlling necessities (No) , use of intimidation, affection, coercion (Yes), changes in person or property rights (Yes).

4. Inequity.  Buy property worth £250,000 for $100,000

This would give our beloved daughter 4 out of 4 for undue influence.  Regarding the fourth metric, this is very closely related if not identical to ‘unfair consideration’.  In the text it stated that if the only metric was this one, it would not be enough to prove undue influence.   

Furthermore in this article there was a case study that quite closely aligned with out case where ‘undue influence’ was effectively used.
 
 I continued my search with : - ‘Insufficient consideration’ + ‘us law’

I wanted to reflect on this term in isolation in relation to US law.  Looking at the top snippet (US Law Essentials) this described what would be common sense that one party gets considerable more value with a transaction leading to the ‘consideration’  not being adequate.  I understood from previous trials that ‘consideration’ was used in a special way and could mean money or other things of value.

I added   +wills         to the end of the search.

I briefly pulled up a Wikipedia article on ‘Consideration’ and quickly shut it down again because I did consider it to be an exceptional source. It would probably qualify as a reasonable source but I was not short of options.

From the ‘People Also Ask’ section I pulled up the US Law Essentials snippet I referred to earlier,
‘What is insufficient consideration?’ (https://uslawessentials.com/2015919…)
I gathered from this article that courts do not care how much consideration you have or do not have.  All they care about is that sufficient consideration exists in a legal sense for it to be valid. Based on my superficial knowledge of consideration this would suggest that buying a $250,000 for $100,000 would be irrelevant to this aspect of the law.

I went back to the snippets and pulled up an article from Cornell Law School ‘Failure of Consideration’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/failure_of_consideration….)

It outlined two key aspects of consideration. One was when it was lacking, there was none at all which inferred the contract was never valid.  The second was that the consideration becomes valueless after the contract which makes it unenforceable.  Neither of these two descriptions fitted with our case.  I followed a link on this site entitle ‘Remedies’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/remedy).  This did not appear relevant to our case at its current stage.

I put into Chrome: -   ‘Undue influence’ + ‘us law’ + wills + cornell

I pulled up the article from the top snippet Cornell Law School ‘Undue Influence’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/undue_influence)  I did not see anything else I could use so I returned to the snippets.

I pulled up another article from Cornell ‘Will Contest’ (law.cornell.edu/wex/will_contest)

This would be relevant to our case in that the son and daughter in our case where conducting a will contest to dispute a will. Presumably this would be during probate.  I gathered that the most common challenge to a Will was ‘undue influence’.  This would concur with my rule of thumb estimation that this would be most dominant based on its dominance online.  I did not see anything of any further particular furhter interest here and flicked back to a previous snippet to see if there were any useful links I could follow.

I pulled up the article on ‘undue influence’ again and followed the link titled ‘unenforceable’  (law.cornell.edu/wex/unenforceable) . ‘ Unenforceable’ was where the courts still see the contract as valid, but will not or cannot do anything to enforce it. I gather an unenforceable contract was not a void contract.

 I went back to ‘undue influence and followed the link to void contracts  (law.cornell.edu/wex/voidable) The meant the contract was valid unless it was rejected by a party with a ‘legally protected’ option to do this. Whilst useful as background this did not further my case.

The timer froze at ‘52’ this time.  With the information I had in front of me and with previous knowledge from other trials I was happy to put the slider up further with a high degree of confidence in (A) ‘undue influence’.

On reading the AI explanation I trusted it for describing flexion and abduction but I think it could get confused and possibly hallucinate when processing descriptions of movement.  For this reason I allocated less confidence than normal in the AI’s answer of (B) Supraspinatous. 

I began my online search in Chrome with: -  
 ‘the patient to position his thumbs downward’ + test + muscle

From the snippet I got ‘Empty Can Test’ (Physiopedia) which mentioned supraspinatous in its truncated description.  I pulled up the article (physio-pedia.com/Empty_Can_Test)

This described the test in our trial and stated it was for the  supraspinatous muscle.  Realistically I could have stopped there but I decided to continue because this seemed too easy. I could confirm this with another respectable site, checkout some unfamiliar terminology and see what the moves for the  infraspinatous muscle were. Maybe there could be a confounding factor down the line somewhere.
  
I watched the video associated with the article to better understand the ‘Empty Can Test’.

I continued my search by replacing ‘muscle’ with ‘supraspinatous’ just to see if there were other tests or the same test on different sites. Many of the snippet descriptions looked to concur with Physiopedia and thought I would be wasting my energy looking for further confirmations. 

I tried swapping  supraspinatous with infraspinatous in the search: 
-   ‘the patient to position his thumbs downward’ + test +  infraspinatous

From the snippets I pulled up an article from Physiopedia  again that described the moves for testing in a similar format to testing  supraspinatous.  I could see that there were a considerable amount of similarities with the  supraspinatous test.  Furthermore I could see how confusion could arise here between the two tests. I could see the differences quite clearly watching but the descriptions both had 90 degrees included and a person or AI could easily overlook that the persons arm was bent and pushing outward and there was no twisting in the infraspinatous test. If my layman’s description was wrapped up in medical terminology the picture could be most confusing.

I looked up the meaning of edamatous : -     edamatous define

  It meant swollen and full of fluid.  I speculated if it was a good idea to even do the Empty Can Test with a damaged shoulder.

I tried: -  edamatous + ‘can test’
On the top snippet I got a description on how to diagnose an edamatous area. It involved pressing it to see if a ‘pit’ forms afterwards.

I tried: -  edamatous + ‘empty can test’
On top snippet I got the post of  Physiopedia for testing  supraspinatous again and I had gone full circle.

I decided that there was no point continuing now and finished early.  I was very clear on the answer of (B) and pulled the slider up to the maximum.

I did not know anything about presenting the money on the day but if the agreement was invalid it would not matter.

On reading the AI explanation this was a game changer in my understanding of the trial, presuming the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was genuine.  I was certain that it would be too much of a stretch to believe the AI had hallucinated this organisation.  Whether its guidelines were legally enforceable was something I needed to look into.  Possibly the AI had decided to be guided by these rules and forgotten the actual law. I thought this scenario was plausible. Furthermore although the description of the case was straightforward enough, the options were not straightforward and I thought that this was another potential stumbling block for the AI.

For these reasons I was not confident at all in the AI’s choice of (A).  Furthermore I had no idea what the correct answer was, given the new information regarding the UCC.  With these factors in mind  I moved the slider back to 50/50.

I began my online research in Chrome with: - ‘Uniform Commercial Code’+ ‘legally enforceable’

I began writing +’us law’ but stopped myself because it would not be necessary if the UCC was a North American organisation, and my search would automatically present for US related sites.

I gathered from the top snippet (Wikipedia) that the UCC was not law.  However it could be enacted by a particular state in which case it would become law.  This added another confounding factor because  I did not know which states had enacted it, which could present a picture of the UCC being enforceable in some states and not in others.

In the ‘People Also Ask’ section I opened a snippet (Brainly.com)  that described mixed contracts and the ‘predominant purpose test’.  If the main purpose was dealing goods then UCC applies. If the main purpose is a service then common law applies.  With our case there was a service element because the bathroom units were delivered but the purpose of the deal was to sell goods so the UCC should apply in our case, if it had been enacted whatever state we are delivering to.
  
   Scrolling through the snippets I gathered that the UCC was well established across the US and had been universally adopted.

I pulled up a snippet from Cornell Law School ‘Obligation of Good Faith’ (law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-304)   It was not useful so I followed a further link on there  ‘Course of Performance, Course of Dealing, and Usage of Trade’ (law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-303)  I did not find that useful either.  

I followed the links to a definition of ‘Good faith’ (law.cornell.edu/ucc/1/1-201#Goodfaith)   I gathered reasonableness and honesty was key.

Returning to the snippets I went to ‘People Also Ask’ and opened the snippet from (Brainly) titled ‘What happens if a dispute occurs over the existence of a contract under the UCC?’  

 This site was explaining the UCC rules and apparently all that was required for a contract to exist was a purchase order. Regarding our case this would suggest there was a valid contract under the UCC rules.

I pulled up another snippet from ‘People Also Ask’  (Nolo.com) ‘What is required for a contract to be enforceable under the UCC?’   

 It had to be in writing, signed by the person who was being enforced and against and had to be more than $500.  I would imagine a first delivery of 25 bathroom units would be much more than $500.  The order in our case was signed in a written order by the bathroom supply company and signed off by the property manager at the other side.  So from the evidence our case looked to be enforceable as a valid contract.  

I pulled up the snippet from Nolo (nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/when…)  I had already established that we had a valid contract, what I really needed to find now were time constraints in relation to UCC rules.

I put into Chrome: -  ‘Uniform Commercial Code’ + payment

I pulled up the top snippet from Cornell Law School ‘Payment’(law.cornell.edu/ucc/3/3-602)
I did not find it useful.

I tried: -  ‘Uniform Commercial Code’ + ‘pay on delivery’ 
I pulled up an article from the top snippet ‘Effect of Seller's Tender; Delivery on Condition.’ (law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-507)

I took ‘seller’s tender’ to mean that the goods had to be delivered by the seller and paid for by the buyer.   In our case the bathroom units  would be the business’s headquarters because according to UCC rules if it is unspecified that was to be the place of delivery.  Payment needed to be in accordance with the contract however in our case the details were not specified.

I pulled up another snippet from ‘People Also Ask’ from BYU-I-Books ‘What does the UCC says about the terms of payment when a contract does not specify them’  

It stated that the payment was due and the ‘time and place’ at which the buyer received the goods.  This was a very indirect way of stating that the goods were due on delivery and it mirrored the way the AI had stated it.  It could easily be misinterpreted.

I was not confident of  ‘BYU-I-Books’ as reliable source so I looked for further confirmations that payment was due on delivery unless arranged otherwise. There were no payment details specified on our bathroom unit delivery so payment terms would default to this. This directly contradicted the AI choice of (A) which stated at a ‘reasonable time’ this was not the same as payment on delivery.

I scrolled down the snippets and spotted the  Cornell snippet which again was quoting ‘payment at the time and place of delivery’ . I pulled up the snippet.

‘Open Time for Payment or Running of Credit; Authority to Ship Under Reservation.’ (law.cornell.edu/ucc/2/2-310)   This was confirmation that payment should be on delivery.  This  invalidated  the AI choice of option (A).

During writing up account I  noticed an inconsistency in the AI explanation because initially the AI stated ‘payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods.’  I did not focus on this term ‘time and place’ and only realised later that this was key to the whole case.

The AI chose  option (A) which stated ‘contract does not specify a payment date, so a reasonable time is implied’.    It appeared that the AI interpreted the UCC regulations incorrectly saying ‘reasonable time and place’.

Possibly the AI had decided to be guided by these rules and forgotten the actual law. I thought this scenario was plausible. Furthermore although the description of the case was straightforward enough, the options were not straightforward and I thought that this was another potential stumbling block for the AI.  For these reasons I was not confident at all in the AI’s choice of (A).  Furthermore I had no idea what the correct answer was, given the new information regarding the UCC.

On reading AI choice of (B), I was not greatly confident in the explanation provided.  I was sceptical of the AI’s explanations. In (A) the AI discussed the important of understanding what truth was and then it discussed the need for reliability.  I would be inclined to think that understanding what truth is tends to infer attempts to be reliable.  Furthermore AI’s are pretty notorious for their difficult relationship with truth, so the AI is possibly not well qualified for this brief.

Regarding the AI’s explanation of (B) it would have helped to convince me if the AI could produce some proper evidence, cases, rulings, quotes from statutes and so forth.  The explanation just looked like word salad to me and not convincing at all.

After reading this I was no wiser so I did not change the slider.

I began my online search in Chrome with : -
  ‘first-hand account’+ child+ victim+ crime+summons          then:  +’american law’ +    at the front
I pulled up the top snippet from Cornell Law School ‘18 U.S. Code § 3509 - Child victims’ and child witnesses’ rights’ (law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/3509)    

Initially my impression was that tests for ‘competency’ were down to the courts decision but getting into the details I refined my view.

I gathered that the tests for competency are overruled by the Federal Rules of Evidence 601.
With the competency rules of examination it is presumed that the child is competent.  This would suggest option (A) rather than option (B).  It goes on to suggest that competency examinations can be ordered by the court only if there is a compelling reason.  The child’s age is not a compelling reason.

This suggested to me that option (A) was correct in contradiction of the AI’s choice.

I had what I needed but I just had the feeling I was missing something and the sense that the AI was failing too many times in my estimation of it generally getting things right.

I continued with: -  competency tests + court + child	then + ‘american law’ at the beginning

I noticed a snippet by the Office of Justice Programs ‘Children's Competency To Testify’ (ojp.gov>ncjrs….)
This snippet concurred with the position of US Law that children are competent to testify.  The grey area was how they reacted in court.  I did not know whether this text was American or English and I would imagine English and American children are probably even in terms of their cognitive abilities given the similar cultures and whatever extent the nature-nurture debate is implicated.

From the snippets I pulled up an article by the American Bar Association ‘Assessing Children's Competency to Testify’   (americanbar.org/groups/public_interest/child_law…) Rule 601 was repeated stating that children were competent to testify concurring with Cornell Law School descriptions of Rule 601 and so on.  Plus it stated that there had to be a compelling reason to do competency test.   Again I was brought to the conclusion that the AI was mistaken in choosing option (B).  
  Furthermore it notes another statute ‘Rule 603’ stating that there was nothing in this rule to indicate a necessity  to prove truthfulness.  However it went on to suggest that many states successfully used this rule to insist that some test was made.  According to this interpretation of the law, strictly speaking they were mistaken so despite common practice I still stayed with option (A) but not without a degree of uncertainty despite what I was seeing in the text.",A,60.0,40.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Granted, assuming there exists a sufficient ground to believe that the child, despite his tender age and traumatic experience, possesses personal knowledge of the incident and comprehends the importance of delivering a truthful account in the court of law.): 60%; B (Allowed, but only if the prosecuting attorney initially presents compelling evidence that convinces the presiding judge of the juvenile witnessâ€™s capacity to provide a reliable testimony, despite his young age and the emotional trauma he has endured.): 40%",60.0,40.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Granted, assuming there exists a sufficient ground to believe that the child, despite his tender age and traumatic experience, possesses personal knowledge of the incident and comprehends the importance of delivering a truthful account in the court of law.): 60%; B (Allowed, but only if the prosecuting attorney initially presents compelling evidence that convinces the presiding judge of the juvenile witnessâ€™s capacity to provide a reliable testimony, despite his young age and the emotional trauma he has endured.): 40%","On reading AI choice of (B), I was not greatly confident in the explanation provided.

In this trial I did not have to worry about any awkward grammar.  Also the change of words was in the same place in each sentence.  This all pointed to a straightforward conclusion in my searches.

I began my online research in Chrome with: ‘complete Lojban’
I was just concentrating on the one place in the two sentences that were different. I did not see it as necessary to confirm translation of all the words that were the same. 

From these trials the google algorithm had been following me and taking note of my preferences, the video promoting the book just kept coming up when I was watching YouTube so I thought I would give the book a try. Looking at it I think I had downloaded it before on another trail.

I tried  ‘jadni’ in here with the local search.  I got a hit, which it translated to ‘adorned’ this corresponded  with the AI definition of adornment.

I tried ‘spali’ and did not get anything. I proceeded to try the english ‘polish’.  I got  one hit in this dictionary for ‘polish’ in relation to ‘nail polish’ but another 26 for its homograph relating to the Polish language. Then I found ‘nail’ and ‘nail polish’.  All the translations corresponded with the AI explanation.

I pulled up another Lojban translation site (vlasisku.lojban) and tried: -    spali 
I got ‘polished object’ which was close to the AI translation.  I looked up ‘nail’  and got jgalu as one of the translations concurring with the AI.

The timer reset itself but I had the screen recorder timer also. I had enough confirmations really but I thought I would continue. 

I put into Chrome :  -   ‘lojban translator’  
I pulled up ‘Lojban’ (mw.lojban.org…) and tried ‘spali’ in its search engine and got ‘polish’ which corresponds with the AI translation. I followed the link to an English to Lojban word list and got ‘spali’ and polish again.

I tried  ‘jadni’ in the mw.lojban search engine and got ‘resurrected gsimu’ according to this page jadni was one of the ‘older’ words in Lojban that had become archaic. According to this list ‘jadni’ had become redundant.

I put:  -  lojban translator    - into Chrome again.  
I pulled up another online dictionary ‘la sutysisku’ (la-lojban.github.io/sutysisku/lojban/…)  
I put ‘adornment’ and got jadni back along with other variations and it described adornment indicating fancy and decorated.

On reading the AI explanation and choice it looked very plausible. I did not think the translation looked confusing for the AI, there were no awkward tenses or anything particularly contrary.

I began my online research with a new idea,  do not know why I had not tried it before. If I couldn’t find an exact match with a particular phrase I could just try adding wildcard characters.  Well that was the theory and in this trial I found it to be spectacularly ineffective.

In Chrome I tried: - 	‘ne'i *’	
I did not think that the phrase from the trial ‘ne'i la .makax’  would get many hits but I thought ne’i, and then some other name might. The * is a wildcard meaning that it can be anything.
That did not work at all, I got hits for rap videos and the periodic table.

I tried: -   ‘ne'i *’ lojban to english
‘Phasebook: Lojban to English’ came to the top of the Google.  I pulled up the site (mw.lojban.org/papri/Phrasebook) and I was on a familiar site in an unfamiliar page.

I tried: -  ‘ne'i la *’ 	In the Lojban site’s search engine and it took me to some index. I did not see anything useful there or in the search.

I tried:  -  ne’i 	
It took me to a very obscure place. I persevered but none of it was any use to me, (mw.lojban.org/papri/Talk...)

I tried: -  within 				In my own laptop’s local search to search through this page. I was just getting into the weeds and making no progress.  I reversed out of this part of the site.

Still in the same site, I went back to the previous search:	 ne’i
Then I tried ‘within’ again in the site search engine and did not find anything useful.

I tried: -    bu’u 	In the same search engine and got some hits that looked promising. I pulled up one of the snippets showing ‘bu’u la’ which was a good sign.  It was a page about a lojban translation of one of Lewis Carol’s works titled  ‘lo selfri be la .alis. bei bu'u la selmacygu'e’

Looking at the last part this corresponded to the option (A) in the trial except that the name was different ‘selmacygu'e’ instead of ‘.makax.’  This was encouraging and an indication that the sentence structure in the question was valid. Looking further I found ‘bu’u la’ which indicated this phrasing was a valid word  combination in Lojban. I copied the full phrase ‘bu'u la fagzda lolgai’. 

I wondered if I may be able to find a translation of Lewis Carol’s work and use it as a reference to see how the phrases in my two options aligned if I swapped certain words. Reverse engineering in a round about way.

I put ‘bu'u la fagzda lolgai’ into Chrome.  Google immediately recognised this as Lewis Carol and pulled up a number of images of the work, with Lojban captions.  

I tried to translate the page with the google translator.  Google moved me to another page.
(wiki-source.org.translate.goog…)  I looked through the list of languages of the translator and Google did not appear to have Lojban. This was getting confusing.

I tried in Chrome: -  ‘bu'u la fagzda lolgai’ lojban
From the snippets I pulled up a Wiki that had bu’u in its title ‘Appendix: Lojban/bu’u’

This was unequivocal it was describing ‘at a location’ linked to bu’u.  This was significant for the trial and one of the key distinctions in the AI discussion.  This corresponded directly with the AI’s translation in option (A).

I tried the same Wiki with: -   ne’i
I got another good result which corresponded again with the AI translation.  ne’i meaning ‘in’.

I went back to Chrome to find some more confirmations of the AI translations which were looking solid. I put ‘Complete Lojban’ into Chrome.   I pulled up ‘The Complete Lojban Language’ (lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_book.pdf) by J.W.Cowan. 

From previous experience this was a decent source for Lojban.  I put -    ne’i     Into my local search.   Got 9 hits which corresponded directly with ‘within’ or ‘In’ concurring with the AI translation. According to this authoritative text ne’i was a spatial tense which fitted very well with its correct usage in option (B).

Next I tried bu’u and got 5 hits with a clear indication that bu’u was associated with ‘at’.  I gathered that this was a location tense.

I finished a little early because I felt that I had enough confirmations and evidence to be extremely confident in the AI choice of (B).  Everything fitted together very well so I put the slider up to the maximum.

I began my online research in Chrome with: -  
			gardener and ‘peripheral artery disease’


I targetted ‘gardener’ first because it appeared to be the most obscure and irrelevant factor in this trial.  In previous trials these factors can sometimes be more significant than they first appear. All I found was that there was an author with ‘Gardner’ as a second name who wrote about PAD.

In Chrome I put just: -  	 ‘peripheral artery disease’
I gathered it was reduced blood flow in the arms or legs. I looked through some snippets and images.

I pulled up an article from the Cleveland Clinic ‘Peripheral Artery Disease’
(my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17357-peripheral-artery-disease-pad)

Reading through this account PAD did indeed correspond with many of the symptoms  of this patient. Furthermore his smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and age increased his chances of PAD developing.  Exercise lessened the symptoms so being a gardener should help.

There were a number of non-invasive tests suggested and then an angiogram was suggested. 

I followed the link titled ‘angiogram’ which was supposed to reveal clotting areas (my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diagnostics/4977-angiography)

I gathered that an angiogram is the next step if there are signs of blocked, abnormal or damaged blood vessels. Our patient had many symptoms indicative of PAD which pointed to an angiogram.

I decided to move my search to investigate the merits of option (B). 

In Chrome I put:  -  ‘ulcer appears dull gray without pus’ and ‘antibiotics’
According to the AI such an ulcer did not require antibiotics.   I gathered from the snippets that it was not as binary as the AI suggested.  Some ulcers do need antibiotics which made my choice of options more difficult. Apparently if the ulcer was not infected it may still need antibiotics if it had developed to the bone. It was unclear if this had occurred. In another snippet The National Institute of Health suggested antibiotics for non healing ulcers. 

 Considering these snippets brought down my confidence in option (A), angiogram first.

I pulled up an article by Health, ‘What Is an Ulcer?’ (health.com/ulcer-7489325)
It was useful background reading on Ulcers but did not bring me closer to any better choice in the trial.

I tried in Chrome (copy and pasted from the trial):
- ‘dorsalis pedis and popliteal pulses were not palpable on thr right’ and pad

then : - ‘When to use Angiograhy’ and PAD
			
I stopped  with my analysis in the last two searches because it was past 20 minutes and to my surprise Google had injected ‘AI Overviews’ at the top of the snippets.  The was a new development and I would have to look at my settings and switch it off if that was possible or use a different browser.   It was a minor part of the search and I do not think it influenced me either way.

Considering the evidence for and against it was not as clear cut as I would have liked.  There were numerous metrics and symptoms that I could have dug into further.
In the balance the AI choice of (A), angiogram looked the best but I was not supremely confident.

I had remembered that there were certain exceptions to admitting previous evidence to  cases if that aspect of the defendant’s history is introduced by one side.  I went with (B), ‘lack of mistake, more because (A) appeared flawed and I did not have a great amount of confidence.

On reading the AI choice and explanation, a convincing case was made for (B) but I would have to do some reading online to feel more confident.

I began my online research in Chrome with: - 

'us law' + 'Can the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the prior scheme be admitted' 

I deliberately did not mention the statute 404 in this search, as introduced by the AI, because I wanted to see if other statutes came up also that the AI may have overlooked.

It so happened that Rule 404 came up as the top snippet concurring with what the AI had targeted.

I pulled up Cornell Law School’s article ‘Rule 404. Character Evidence; Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts’  (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_404)

Reading through the account I noticed that 404.3(b2) basically paraphrased the statute  the AI had described. Section (B) referred to ‘Other Crimes Wrongs or Acts’ this went on to highlight that certain evidence (evidence against the defendant) could be admitted from absence of mistake.

Presumably this infers that once you introduce ‘absence of mistake’ , the prosecutor can then use, not absence of mistake to mount an attack.

Further along in the account it then clarifies  a point in 404(b) that suggests that when information is offered, it is not excluded.

All this looked to correspond with the AI explanation.

I followed the link by Cornell at the bottom of the page ‘Rule 403. Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, Waste of Time, or Other Reasons’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403)

Looking at Rule 403 it was set up as a way of stopping defendants tying up proceeding in essence using ‘filibuster’ tactics.  I really did not think this was the situation in our trial with option (B). It appeared that it was part of a narrow window of defences available to our defendant to save his career and reputation.

I tried in Chrome: -  'us law' +tax+ 'Can the evidence of the defendant's involvement in the prior scheme be admitted'

I pulled up a United States Department of Justice Pdf ‘Criminal Tax Manual’ (justice.gov/media/1239021/dl?inline)

I wanted to see how Rule 404 applied to tax matters.  I was running low on time and looking through the Pdf I could not see any reference to Rule 404 or 403 in the text.  I could only surmise the tax matters existed as a separate entity in US law of which I had little knowledge. In the text there were numerous references to accountants adding the previous years returns to the current year as our defendant did.  This added some uncertainty to my choice, I could not help suspecting that the our crooked defendant was in the wrong court.

In the final instance I went with the AI’s choice of option (B) but not without a good amount of uncertainty.

From the snippets I pulled up a professional law firm Heslin Law, ‘The Importance of Pursuing a Civil Drunk Driving Lawsuit’  (heslinlawfirm.com/blog/philadelphia-civil-dui-cases.cfm)

The account was unequivocal in stating that evidence from the criminal case could be used to strengthen a civil case. I also gathered that DUI (Driving Under the Influence) was the key acronym I needed for further searches.

I tried:	 ‘us law’ + ‘dui’ + Civil + ‘prior conviction’
I pulled up the site from Cornell Law School, ‘Rule 609. Impeachment by Evidence of a Criminal Conviction’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_609)

I gathered that  a conviction could be inadmissible in either a civil  or criminal case if the person had a ‘certificate of rehabilitation’, presumably after the conviction.  Our defendant was just contrite that she did the crash while under the influence. I imagine that cases may take time to book and if she got busy she might had an angle to pursue there.
There were other irrelevant exceptions mentioned such as a crime older than 10 years that may stop admission.

I admit ignorance in attempting to interpret one passage that quoted Rule 609(a) regarding a court admitting convictions in a civil case that, paraphrasing - did not have anything to do with the credibility to reach undesirable results. This was incomprehensible to me at that moment. I imagine I would need to spend quite some time reading the actual statute rather an interpretation of the statute to get anywhere with it.

With regards to option (A) I was very confident that the AI had got it right there, so however confusing option (B) was, in a sense it did not matter and wins by default.

On reading the AI explanation and choice of option (A) I was convinced that the AI had hallucinated. I can only speculate but based on its choice of option (A) it had attempted to read between the lines and make an interpretation based on what it inferred the author was meaning rather than what was actually on the page.  This I would deem as a hallucination.

It was clear that the AI mistakenly interpreted from the last sentence quoted above as referring to the police officer with the pronouns ‘this’ and ‘their’.  Holding this interpretation  went against the standard rules of correct interpretation. 

Based on the little the AI had  noted regarding option (B) and my imperfect memory of past trials I felt that someone could make a specious argument in favour of option (B) which was not 100% impossible.   Based on this premise I had an expectation in favour of 100% for option (B) because option (A) is impossible, rather than 50/50, best response I had for both impossible. 

I put 94 % for B) and not 100%  because I was holding out that I may have overlooked something.

I decided to try and justify a tenuous case for option (B) because that was the only option left to me.

I began in Chrome with: - ‘us law’ + ‘  nonessential, irrelevant topics’
From the top snippet from Cornell Law School I read that evidence was irrelevant if it did not affect or relate to the matter in controversy.    I supposed that someone could contend that we already knew that the driver was not denying his intoxication and there was no point calling the a witness to that effect.  It would be reasonable to presume that the police officer has breathalysed the driver in accordance with standard practice, but there was no mention of it in the trial.  Could such be inferred ?

I pulled up the article from Cornell titled ‘irrelevant’(law.cornell.edu/wex/irrelevant)
Based on Rule 401(a) if the evidence was more likely to make the fact look less or more probable then it should be admitted. In our case this would be more because the witness was saying the driver was drunk, so this would lessen the likelihood of (B) being valid.

I following the link for ‘Rule 401’ still on the Cornell Law School page (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_401) to article  ‘Rule 401. Test for Relevant Evidence’

The article went into a discussion about probative value, once it was established that the driver was intoxicated the witness had little value after,  other than describing the level of intoxication.

I followed a link at the bottom of the page (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/article_IV)
‘Article IV. Relevance an its limits’
This led to a small table of contents of associated topics. I clicked on ‘Rule 403. Excluding Relevant Evidence for Prejudice, Confusion, Waste of Time, or Other Reason’  (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_403)

The relevant evidence we are considering is the first hand account of the co-passenger should he take the stand.
Looking at the synopsis an argument could be to exclude relevant evidence on time wasted and pointlessly describing things the court already knows.  There was not much more to add regarding this page.

I  following the link at the bottom of the last page for ‘Rule 404. Character Evidence; Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_40)
There was not much I could use there.

I followed a further link from the last page ‘609’ 
‘Rule 609. Impeachment by Evidence of a Criminal Conviction’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_609)
I gathered that wasting time was an issue again and that the credibility of the witness could be attacked for various reasons, but our witness appeared to be going against his own best interests by going against his travelling companion.

Summing up a weak argument could be made for (B) which was the only viable option because option (A) was irrelevant.

On reading the Ai Explanation and choice of (A) I was not all that convinced.  The differences in the two sentences were rather subtle,  possibly something the AI might get tangled over.
Also with regards to the AI discussion with verbs, I was rather uncomfortable with the AI explaining Lojban from an English frame of reference. I would have imagined what was correct for that language was to stay true to the conventions of that language.

The AI taking the alternative option was enough for me to bring the slider back to the middle.

I began my online investigation with: - complete lojban
I pulled up ‘The Complete Lojban Language’ by J.W.Cowan
(lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_book.pdf)

I focussed on the last few words that were different around ‘xumre’ which I gather from the AI was the colour red. I was quite happy to accept this as the correct definition for ‘xumre’.

After pulling up the Pdf I continued with my local windows search which would look through the Pdf for selected words for me.

I began with ‘carna’  - I got no hits.  Then ‘xunre’ just to check, it corresponded directly with the AI translation of red.

Next I tried ‘become’ but did not find anything in the right context.  Become was key to deciding which option was best. The AI was stating that,  ""co'a xunre"" means ""become red"".  I was looking for confirmation or otherwise of the meaning of co’a. It did not matter so much about something becoming red, just that the notion of co’a being ‘becoming’ was valid.   From this authoritative text it seemed to indicate that co’a was more about beginnings which raised some question marks. The text suggested that it was part of a set of words representing points in time or sometimes points in space.

It was not a complete event as suggested by the AI and then at the end of the text there was the definition that described it unequivocally as a starting point.

I then tried ‘cu’.  It was some kind of separator.  The text described it as coming at the beginning of any ‘sumti’ or ‘selbri’ and was often left out.

I went back to Chrome and typed in: lojban grammar wiki
(en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lojban_grammar)
I pulled it up ‘Lojban Grammar’

I could try and get more confirmations and definitions here. 
I put in ‘Carna’- still nothing
I tried ‘turn’ - got nothing in the right context.

I typed into Chrome: carna lojban to english. 
I ignored the Google translate and pulled up  (jbovlaste.lojban.org/lookup.plForm=lookup.pl2&Database=*&Query=carna)
This had ‘carna’ as, rotates or turns about an axis.  This suggested ‘turning red’ may be a more novel or symbolic usage. There was a little history about the word which indicated that it was one of the newer additions to Lojban.  This could have lead to the AI being less accepting of its usage in this context.

I typed into Chrome: - lojban dictionary
I pulled up ‘User:Gleki/Lojban Dictionary with Examples’
(mw.lojban.org/papri/User:GlekiLojban_Dictionary_with_Examples)

I typed ‘carna’ into the site search engine and got turns/rotates around an axis again.  That was a good enough confirmation.

In one of the examples I  noted that ‘pritu carna’ meant ‘turn right’ and this structure fitted with the replacement of ‘xumre carna’ for  ‘turn red’ leaving the verb at the end as I gather is usual in some Lojban phrases.

Thought I might as well try co’a again and did not get anything useful.  I reversed the search back to a more central part of the site to: 
/jbovlaste.lojban.org/lookup.pl?Form=lookup.pl….

Then I tried ‘co’a’ again. I got a definition as ‘starting point’ again.

I went back to the ‘la sutysiku’ site which translates Lojban and tried ‘turn’
The result was ‘carna’. With similar definitions from other sites.

I then tried co’a again and got further confirmations of ‘starting point’.

I then closed my activities (by now the Modulo questions site had reset).

My online research pointed to (B) being the best answer in contradiction to the AI.

On reading the AI explanation and choice of (A) I was more confident with my choice. The AI had filled a lot of the gaps.  I just wondered whether it had extrapolated too much.

I began my online investigations in Chrome with: - 
		acute otitis media and temporal bones diagnosis

On reading the top snippet from the National Institute of Health (NIH) a computed tomography (CT) scan was suggested if complications with Otitis Media are suspected in relation to temporal bones. This appeared to concur with the AI choice of (A).

I pulled up the article ‘Acute Otitis Media’ (ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK470332/)
This article appeared quite central to me, I could just do a fast track search and target diagnosis and certain keywords but time permitting I wanted to read it all to get a thorough grounding in this area.  I opted to get the best of both approaches by targeting certain keywords using my local scan – imaging, ct.

The material was dense with unfamiliar terms and concepts so I approached it two ways. Some intentional repetition can bring forward understanding in my experience.

I gathered that generally CT is not recommended for  Acute Otitis Media (AOM) but if a complication is suspected that it is recommended.  There was a conflict of views between the Netherlands and the US.  The argument put forward by American Institutions was that if someone waits then they can risk serious conditions escalating and becoming impossible to salvage.
I noted a list of really serious conditions which centred on the temporal bones.

I also understood that the use of antibiotics are considered controversial unless a clear  diagnosis of AOM is indicated. Highlighted in this journal was that  intracranial and intra-temporal complications are central to deciding to use a CT scan.

I  wanted to pursue these two avenues further. I put into Chrome: 
 intracranial complications define

Looking at the top snippet nothing appeared to correlate with the trial description but certain features came up with what the AI had expanded upon.

I pulled up ‘Orbital and Intracranial Complications of Acute and Chronic Rhinosinusitis’  (link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-0265-1_27#)

I gathered that if there was a complication to AOM then CT or something with similar capabilities was recommended. I could see the complications described by the AI but it seemed rather embellished to me. These complications may have been inferred by the conditions described by the trial but I really wanted something more concrete.

I looked down the list of symptoms in the ‘People Always Ask’ section. Tinnitus was indicated along a  list of other symptoms that did not quite fit the trial description.

I tried in Chrome:  intra-temporal complications define
I understood this had nothing to do with time ! Google produced a list of time related snippets.

I tried: - 	intra-temporal or intracranial complications and Acute Otitus Media

In the snippet (ScienceDirect) mastoiditis and others were indicated as described by the AI along with a number of other very serious conditions.

I pulled up the article from the International Journal of Pediatric Otorhinolaryngology
‘Intratemporal and intracranial complications of acute otitis media in a pediatric population’ (sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165587614005540#)

Post auricular pain was indicated to suggest there may be intratemporal complications.  This was good enough for me.  Our case had pain behind the left ear.  

Furthermore if hearing was affected this could indicate a swelling inside which could quickly become very serious.  This was a major concern with the wait and see approach of the Netherlands with hearing and speech problems.

I returned to the original journal I pulled up at the beginning  ‘Acute Otitis Media’ 
I put in :-	imaging
 This was to see if there were further paths to journals I may want to follow up.

I clicked on reference 25 and followed a ‘PubMed’ link to ‘Intracranial complications of otitis media: 15 years of experience in 33 patients’ (pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15632907/)
I did not find anything of any further use to me in there.

I went back to the original journal then back to Google search

I tried: imaging + intra-temporal or intracranial complications and Acute Otitus Media.

The same study came back to the top and I stopped my search there because I was over the time limit.

I went with option (A) but not with a great amount of confidence.

On reading the AI explanation its choice concurred and filled in some of the gaps in my initial impressions. I was almost certain that this was the correct answer now but would need to do some research online to confirm it.

I began my online investigation into Chrome with:
‘dying declaration’ + hearsay + exceptions

On reading the top snippet from Cornell Law School it confirmed my initial view and  the AI’s explanation.  I pulled up the site.

‘Dying Declaration’  (law.cornell.edu/wex/dying_declaration#….)

I gathered from the site that the words of our declarant were indeed a deathbed declaration.  Furthermore I gathered that to be admissible the declaration must relate to the circumstances or cause of the declarants demise.  This former did indeed align again since he was heard by the nurse fifteen minutes before his death  saying ""I was hit by a car that blatantly ignored the traffic signal and sped through the intersection.""
This evidence was corroborated by the doctor’s affidavit.

Regarding general rules of hearsay the declaration needs to be the declarant’s actual knowledge.  The again concurred with the declarant’s utterances.

I could have left the case here with 99% confidence but I wanted to continue just to see if there was any way I could undermine my own position in this matter.

I pulled up a Pdf from the bottom of the Cornell article from the Indiana University Law Review  (https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent…) ‘Her Last Words: Dying Declarations and Modern Confrontation Jurisprudence’ A. A. Orenstein (2010).

After reading the first two pages of this lengthy tome I had already read enough.  It was critiquing the deathbed hearsay exception going far away into the hinterlands of how and why this law came about.  It was a niche theoretical text with a feminist theme. There was no way I was going to waste my time continuing with it.

I returned to the Cornell article which was more central and tried another link entitled ‘Section 804(b)(2)’.  This took me to an article still on the Cornell site ‘Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804)

It began with the criteria for being unavailable in 804 (a).  In section 4, being dead was a valid reason and our declarant fitted into this category!

In the Section 804(b)(2) of this article, further confirmations that hearsay was allowed if it was believed that the declarant was indeed dying, plus there was a cause/circumstances element.   I speculated that if the belief in the immanent death was a delusion would it still be valid ? Common sense suggests not.
I looked further with ‘death’ in my local search. There was nothing else I could see here that was relevant or did not repeat the same point of law.

I reversed my search and pulled up a case from a link in the first Cornell Law School site I went to (‘Dying Declaration’) entitled ‘People v. Bartelini’  (casetext.com/case/people-v-bartelini)

This account emphasised the importance of proof of dying declarations and in this case without this proof there could not have been any judgement.  Our case was made more solid by not only a permitted hearsay account by a nurse but also another  in the form of a signed affidavit of a doctor.

I stopped the timer a few minutes early and moved the slider to the maximum because I had more than enough material to support my choice of option (A) and refute option (B).

On reading the AI explanation this concurred with my view with a similar observance that the contract was in place to enforce their policy of not paying commissions if the salesman was no longer employed by them.

When I began my online research I struggled initially to find the right combination of words to find what I needed.  It suggested to me that what I was looking for was not very dominant in Google searches. I even suspected a bias against employees from the Google algorithm.  Normally my searches hit first time, so this seemed rather odd to me.

I put into Chrome:  ‘unfair contract’+ sales +sue		then + ‘us law’ added to the end

No useful snippets were coming up and Google was interpreting ‘sue’ as ‘Sue’s Law’  as the most dominant search phase.  It offered the option to go with the less dominant  term ‘sue’. I went with this and did not get anything useful. At the bottom of the page Google indicated that some results had been omitted.  I clicked the link to see what. I did not get anything.  Just images where coming up presumably because they did not appear to have any snippets.  This was most unusual.

I replaced ‘sue’ with ‘sales’  in Chrome: 	‘unfair contract’+ sales + ‘us law’

I gathered from the top snippet that there was no all encompassing law regarding unfair contract terms.  I disposed of the thought experiment I outlined at the beginning to press a case for unfair dismissal, although to complicate matters the law was different for different states.

I was not seeing much from the snippets so I replaced another term.

I put into Chrome:  	‘unfair contract’+ salesman + ‘us law’
I did not see anything useful and the search was not focussing well to target the US.

I tried in Chrome: 		‘unfair contract’+ commission+ ‘us law’ + employment

Looking at the snippets I was getting closer, but not close enough.

I tried: 	‘unfair contract’+ commission+ ‘us law’ + employment+salesmen
The top snippet (Henrichson Law Group)  was mentioning about companies trying to withhold  commissions and tying things up legally, this was looking better.

I tried:  ‘unpaid commission’ + ‘contract + employment        then ‘us law’ + to the beginning of search
I did not get much except that not paying commissions was a very serious business.

I tried:  ‘us law’+ ‘unpaid commission’ + ‘contract employment’ + statue
Google had decided to change my typo ‘statue’ to ‘status’.   I pulled up the top website anyway because it was entitled, ‘Your Guide to Unpaid Commissions’
(employeelawgroup.com/your-guide-to-unpaid-commissions)

This site gave a detailed background on commissions and also listed the many ways that companies attempt to cheat salespeople out of commissions. They termed it ‘wrongful termination’, that is, sacking people to avoid paying commissions. This was what was happening in our case. It suggested filing a claim for wage theft with the states department of industrial relations.  
  They were also suggesting that the contract may have been ‘unconscionable’ which meant it put the salesperson at a distinct disadvantage.  Then I got to the real meat of this article for our case – the ‘forfeiture clause’.   This was the term I needed.   I wondered why our AI had not suggested it because it opened the door for further investigation. 
  What was impossible for me to reconcile was that they were writing from the perspective of California law and offered a strand of hope saying that the forfeiture clause may not be enforceable in California.  This posed to problem for our case because there was no indication of where the sales company in the trial was based or for that matter where the sale was made.

This was starting to look promising  except they were not a neutral website and they were selling their services. I put it on the back burner for the time being with the intention of possibly returning to it later in the current 20 minute session.
 
I reversed back to chrome and different sites were showing.

The top snippet was from ‘Smith Law Llc’  it described that commission should be paid if a salesperson loses their job. I pulled up the site, ‘Unpaid Commissions: What happens to commissions payable after termination?’  Strictly this was not exactly what I wanted because the crux of the matter was that the company had set up a forfeiture clause to deny this. 

In the first paragraph the site outlined this issue.

This Georgia site was discussing the exact area I needed to look into.  They offered hope to the salesperson saying that courts frowned upon contracts of the type that were in our trial.  They went on the mention that these contracts were lawful and enforceable unless there was something ambiguous in the terms.  As far as I knew there was nothing in the salesman’s contract that suggested ambiguity so I was still in the option (B) camp but not 100% now.

 I was mindful of the liberal tendencies of California and Georgia so if our trial was based there our salesman would have half a chance of prevailing in court. Of the other 48 states I could not say.

I put into Chrome: 
‘us law’+ ‘unpaid commission’ + ‘contract employment’ + ‘forfeiture clause’

I scrolled down the snippets and pulled up another site that alluded to ‘forfeiture clause’. It was another professional legal site, YusafButtar,  ‘Are Commissions Owed After Termination of Employment?’ (buttar-law.com/are-commissions-owed-after-termination-of-employment/)
The site was rather vague but tended to state in various paragraphs that if there was ‘cause’ then the salesperson would not prevail.  They also stated the confounding issue for me that different states approached these matters differently.

From the ‘People also search for’ at the bottom of the page I followed the Google suggestion, ‘Suing for unpaid commissions’

Top snippet (Myers & Co.) stated that as an employee you are entitled to be paid according to your contract.    That was not useful to me.

I put into Chrome:  ‘Suing from unpaid commissions’ + ‘forfeiture provisions’+ ‘us law’
From the snippets I gathered that even in Georgia our salesman would not prevail unless there was ambiguity.

Returning to the snippets I pulled up Shouse Law Group California ‘California Law on Commission Pay After Termination’
(shouselaw.com/ca/blog/california-law-on-commission-pay-after-termination/)

I was thinking if it was dubious for California too, there would be little concrete hope for our salesman.  This site explained the ‘forfeiture provisions’ in starker terms.  Our salesman had no chance.

I tried:  ‘Suing from unpaid commissions’ + ‘forfeiture provisions’+ ‘us law’+ ‘won’

I pulled up from the snippets, Just Answer, ‘Can I sue my employer for unpaid commissions ?’  (justanswer.com/employment-law...)
It was a question and answer regarding commissions.  It was supposed to be an expert at the other side.  It was not useful in any way and  judging by the style of writing it was not a human expert, probably just a sales bot.

On reading the AI explanation I was somewhat sceptical, it looked like something the AI could mix up. I went a few degrees only in favour of the AI’s choice of option (A),  which according to the AI used  ‘mi'o’ to include ‘I’ and ‘you’.  
All I needed to do was to check my most reliable online resources and see if the AI had worked it out correctly for ‘mi’o’ and ‘mi’a’.

I began my online investigation with ‘complete Lojban’
I pulled up ‘The Complete Lojban Language’ by  J.W.Cowan (lojban.org/publications/cll/cll_v1.1_book.pdf)

I was happy to trust this authoritative text, if I could understand it. It was not as simple as the ‘instant’ online translators which could be extremely poor.  This work just took a little more reading and understanding to manage.

I put into my local windows search with the Pdf still up:	 mi’o

I got 13 hits for this.  Clicked to each section with ‘mi’o’ and read around some of the theory too. It was very clear to me that the AI had got it spot on this time.
Something that I did notice that the AI had successfully navigated was that ‘mi’o’ and ‘mi’a’ where often mentioned together with other related words so I imagined that could be confusing for a person or an AI if they did not really get a handle on what the text was driving at. 
I noticed one particular sentence (pp.140 or 6/14 on local search) in the Lobjan book where it discussed  mi'o, mi'a, ma'a, and do'o  as a group of related forms.  If just this sentence had been scraped by the AI without the related context it would be too universal to differentiate the meanings of ‘mi’a’ and ‘mi’o’ and effectively would not make any sense at all.  In the sentence it was using ‘and/or’ in combination with the listener, speaker and other people.  It was valid with regards to describing the collective scope of these forms but it smudges the individual meanings.

With regards to ‘mi’a’ it was mentioned on many of the same pages as mi’o.  Mi’a was in option (B) and the AI concurred precisely with the Complete Lojban in excluding the listener.

Content with what I had found in this work I returned to Chrome to find a corroborating source.

I put into Chrome:   lojban dictionary
I pulled up the ‘The Logical Language Group, Online Dictionary Query’
(jbovlaste.lojban.org/lookup.pl?Form=…)  It was some kind of meta-search engine that I had found decent results from before.

In the jbovlaste search  I put in: 		mi’a
It was not the most user friendly of resources but I had found reliable results in the past. It listed out Lojban to different languages.  In the Lojban to English part it clearly describe ‘mi’a’  in a way that aligned very clearly with the AI definition,  ‘we, not you’ and so on.

This could be a little disconcerting because it automatically put searches in  to its engine that were links too, and filled the search before I got back to the main query page.

I put in:		 mi’o
I got the confirmation I needed concurring with the AI explanation in option (A) and the Complete Lojban book.

I finished a few minutes early because I had what I needed.

On reading the AI  explanation and choice,  this helped me fill in the gaps of knowledge and I was more confident with option (A). 

I began my online investigation in  Chrome with: 
‘opposing party’ + hearsay

From the top snippet (Cornell Law School) this concurred with the AI explanation stating that party-opponents are excluded from the category of hearsay. In our case the opponents would be the security personnel  
since a certain officer employed there had been charged with manslaughter and his testimony was to be presented at the civil proceedings in the form of a verified transcript. 

I pulled up the article from the top snippet ‘Rule 801. Definitions That Apply to This Article; Exclusions from Hearsay’
(law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_801#)

Reading through the conditions that were  NOT hearsay which continued from 801(d) we have 801(d)(2)(D) titled ‘Opposing Parties Statement’ which appeared to be relevant for our security guard. This described a party agent while he was in that role.  This would fit with the security guard before he stopped being employed there. This would indicate that our security guard’s transcript is admissible.

It also continued with  801(d)(2) regarding Admissions. I gathered that an admission was a statement made by the declarant which is being used against himself.  Apparently in theory this would give him an opportunity to deny, explain or refute  the statement and so on.  Unfortunately this was not possible, he could not do that because he was refusing to attend on the grounds that he was in the middle of a manslaughter appeal.

After reading through Rule 801 I think I had found what I needed, I decided to continue a little longer and look at some of the related links.

Following the link at the bottom of the page ‘Article V111-Hearsay’
(law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/article_VIII)  I got the impression that this page was getting much further out from where I needed to look and was not directly relevant for my case.  However I found a link at the bottom of the page that may  offer better prospects. I clicked on ‘Rule 804. Hearsay Exceptions; Declarant Unavailable’ (law.cornell.edu/rules/fre/rule_804)

As I mentioned previously our security guard had refused to attend on the grounds that he has in the middle of a manslaughter appeal.  I thought this rule may shed to some light on why he was justified in not attending. I gathered the 5th amendment may be valid here and he may be reticent because of self incrimination.

The legal rhetoric was getting hard to manage but 804(B)(1)(b) appeared to suggest that since our guard had been cross examined in the criminal trial previously under court conditions that would be good enough. I would suppose this would apply to allowing the presentation of the verified transcript at the civil case.

I had got to the end of my 20 minutes so I went to the questions page and put the slider to a high confidence in option (A). I was not supremely confident because I felt I could have easily overlooked some significant factor because of all the clauses and sub-clauses in the legal discussion.

the following requirements must be followed for silence to be deemed acceptance:

The offer must be concise and specific: Silence must be regarded acceptance if the offer is explicit and not subject to interpretation.
The offeree must be aware of the offer: For silence to be deemed acceptance, the offeree must be informed of the offer and its conditions.
The offer must be made in conditions when silence would be considered unusual: Silence must be fair to suppose that a response would be anticipated if the offeree did not plan to accept for silence to be deemed acceptance.
The offeree must be given a fair chance to reject the offer: The offeree must be given a fair length of time to contemplate the offer and, if desired, reject it.
The offeror must not specify that silence is not an acceptable form of acceptance: The offeror must not state that silence is not an acceptable form of acceptance, nor must a particular action be taken to accept the offer.
It is always better to get legal guidance if in doubt. Furthermore, remember that silence is not always regarded as an acceptable form of approval, particularly in contracts with substantial monetary value or legal ramifications, where verbal assent is frequently necessary.

Silent contracts generally are not valid. When someone makes you an offer and you do not respond to it, you normally will not be bound to a contract.

Undue influence is one of the grounds of relief developed by the courts of equity as a court of conscience. The objective is to ensure that the influence of one person over another is not abused. In everyday life people constantly seek to influence the decisions of others. They seek to persuade those with whom they are dealing to enter into transactions, whether great or small. The law has set limits to the means properly employable for this purpose. The law will investigate the manner in which the intention to enter into the transaction was secured: If the intention was produced by an unacceptable means, the law will not permit the transaction to stand. The means used is regarded as an exercise of improper or 'undue' influence, and hence unacceptable, whenever the consent thus procured ought not fairly to be treated as the expression of a person's free will. It is impossible to be more precise or definitive. The circumstances in which one person acquires influence over another, and the manner in which influence may be exercised, vary too widely to permit of any more specific criterion.

The privilege against self-incrimination parries the general obligation to provide testimony under oath when called upon, but it also applies in police interrogations. In all cases, the privilege must be supported by a reasonable fear that a response will be incriminatory. The issue is a matter of law for a court to determine,  and therefore, with limited exceptions, one must claim the privilege to benefit from it. Otherwise, silence in the face of questioning may be insufficient to invoke the privilege because it may not afford an adequate opportunity either to test whether information withheld falls within the privilege or to cure a violation through a grant of immunity.  The woman invoked her right to remain silent to avoid self-incrimination only, she didnt explicitly plead the fifth, so it will be Disallow , on the grounds that the woman relinquished this right by choosing to testify voluntarily.

A witness who fails to claim the privilege explicitly when an affirmative claim is required is deemed to have waived it, and waiver may be found where the witness has answered some preliminary questions but desires to stop at a certain point. However, an assertion of innocence in conjunction with a claim of the privilege does not obviate the right of witnesses to invoke it, as their responses still may provide the government with evidence it may later seek to use against them.",A,45.0,55.0,"Before reading the AI's answer: A (Validate it, given that the right against self-incrimination is applicable in both civil and criminal proceedings.): 45%; B (Disallow it, on the grounds that the woman relinquished this right by choosing to testify voluntarily.): 55%",40.0,60.0,"After reading the AI's answer: A (Validate it, given that the right against self-incrimination is applicable in both civil and criminal proceedings.): 40%; B (Disallow it, on the grounds that the woman relinquished this right by choosing to testify voluntarily.): 60%",,

For example, Rule 608(b) prohibits counsel from mentioning that a witness was suspended or disciplined for the conduct that is the subject of impeachment, when that conduct is offered only to prove the character of the witness. See United States v. Davis, 183 F.3d 231, 257 n.12 (3d Cir. 1999) (emphasizing that in attacking the defendant's character for truthfulness “the government cannot make reference to Davis's forty-four day suspension or that Internal Affairs found that he lied about” an incident because “[s]uch evidence would not only be hearsay to the extent it contains assertion of fact, it would be inadmissible extrinsic evidence under Rule 608(b)”). See also Stephen A. Saltzburg, Impeaching the Witness: Prior Bad Acts and Extrinsic Evidence, 7 Crim. Just. 28, 31 (Winter 1993) (“counsel should not be permitted to circumvent the no-extrinsic-evidence provision by tucking a third person's opinion about prior acts into a question asked of the witness who has denied the act.”).


The Rule has been amended to clarify that the absolute prohibition on extrinsic evidence applies only when the sole reason for proffering that evidence is to attack or support the witness’ character for truthfulness. See United States v. Abel, 469 U.S. 45 (1984); United States v. Fusco, 748 F.2d 996 (5th Cir. 1984) (Rule 608(b) limits the use of evidence “designed to show that the witness has done things, unrelated to the suit being tried, that make him more or less believable per se”); Ohio R.Evid. 608(b). On occasion the Rule's use of the overbroad term “credibility” has been read “to bar extrinsic evidence for bias, competency and contradiction impeachment since they too deal with credibility.” American Bar Association Section of Litigation, Emerging Problems Under the Federal Rules of Evidence at 161 (3d ed. 1998). The amendment conforms the language of the Rule to its original intent, which was to impose an absolute bar on extrinsic evidence only if the sole purpose for offering the evidence was to prove the witness’ character for veracity.

According to https://www.legalzoom.com/articles/understanding-your-unilateral-contract

Specific to the performance type, the old law was that—even if the offeree had started performing—the offeror could still revoke the contract. This is no longer the case: Once an offeree starts a physical performance of the contract, the offeror can't revoke a unilateral contract. For example, once the person begins climbing the Empire State Building steps, the offeror must pay if the person completes the task.

However, the offeror can revoke the reward type of unilateral contract at any time, so long as the offeror clearly conveys that they've revoked the offer. (If the offeror posted signs for the reward, then the offeror should post similar signs stating that they've revoked the unilateral contract.) In a reward type contract, the contract isn't fully performed if the dog hasn't been found. Accordingly, an offeror of a unilateral contract for such a reward can revoke it at any time before the dog is found.

i believe this unilateral contract between the bank and the customer is a reward type for compensation which can be revoked since the bank declared and removed the sign before the customer 5 minutes lapsed.

states that Modifications that reduce the scope of a contract
As described in RR 2.9.2, a modification is accounted for as a separate contract only if distinct goods or services are added to the contract for a price equal to standalone selling price (adjusted for contract-specific circumstances). Modifications that reduce the scope of a contract would not be accounted for as a separate contract because they do not solely add distinct goods or services to the contract. Therefore, the accounting for a modification that reduces the scope of a contract depends on whether the remaining goods or services are distinct from the goods or services transferred before the modification:
If the remaining goods or services are distinct (including goods or services that are part of a series), the modification is accounted for prospectively as if it were a termination of the existing contract and creation of a new contract. Refer to RR 2.9.3.1.
If the remaining goods or services are not distinct (for example, a single performance obligation is being modified), the modification is accounted for on a cumulative catch-up basis. Refer to RR 2.9.3.2. which still makes the contruction company not to violate the contract, but

 Consideration is a legal term used to describe the benefit each party to a contract receives. This is often payment in exchange for goods or services. Consideration doesn't actually have to be money though – it can be anything of value that you get as part of a contract, like equipment or work.

Prior acts of criminality are not admissible to prove that the person committed a similar crime, i.e., if Bill Cosby is on trial for sexually assaulting Andrea Constand in Philadelphia in 2004, the prosecutor cannot call Beth Ferrier as a witness to testify that Cosby gave her drugs and sexually assaulted her in 1986. Nor can he call 50 women to testify Cosby drugged and assaulted them. The only reason it would be relevant is prove that he has a pattern of criminal behavior, which is also known as character evidence.
The prosecutor needs to come up with a relevant reason why the jury should hear about Cosby’s past acts. It must be a genuine disputed issue of real consequence or Rule 403 will exclude it. The prejudicial effect is obvious -- the whole world has made up its mind that Cosby is guilty based solely on the number of claims.

The theory finds vast support in the many exceptions to the hearsay rule developed by the common law in which unavailability of the declarant is not a relevant factor. The present rule is a synthesis of them, with revision where modern developments and conditions are believed to make that course appropriate.

In a hearsay situation, the declarant is, of course, a witness, and neither this rule nor Rule 804 dispenses with the requirement of firsthand knowledge. It may appear from his statement or be inferable from circumstances.

See Rule 602.

Exceptions (1) and (2). In considerable measure these two examples overlap, though based on somewhat different theories. The most significant practical difference will lie in the time lapse allowable between event and statement.

The underlying theory of Exception [paragraph] (1) is that substantial contemporaneity of event and statement negative the likelihood of deliberate of conscious misrepresentation. Moreover, if the witness is the declarant, he may be examined on the statement. If the witness is not the declarant, he may be examined as to the circumstances as an aid in evaluating the statement. Morgan, Basic Problems of Evidence 340–341 (1962).

The theory of Exception [paragraph] (2) is simply that circumstances may produce a condition of excitement which temporarily stills the capacity of reflection and produces utterances free of conscious fabrication. 6 Wigmore §1747, p. 135. Spontaneity is the key factor in each instance, though arrived at by somewhat different routes. Both are needed in order to avoid needless niggling.

Senior courts have ruled that dying declarations can be an exception to the sixth amendment and are admissible as evidence in court and are not, as such, testimonial in nature.

I came across the confrontation clause later in the search and read about how it might impact upon dying declarations in a 2012 article.

Quitclaim deeds may vary according to the state but in general terms, Xavier has to fulfill his contract to pay Zoey the full amount. The fact that he gained nothing is down to his lack of due diligence in ensuring that Zoey had the rights to transfer the land over to his ownership. 

I found Wikipedia a useful source of information and used it to search out more formal sources which were mostly lawyers' pages along with some reality-related sites.

After getting nowhere, I found that ""ku"" is an elidable terminator and later searched for what that was. It did not help. In frustration, I searched for a Lojban translator and entered both sentences on different lines. The first translation appears to be closer to the English sentence in the question. I also discovered the word for ""finished"" which can be written as ""mo'u"". Although I am unsure of Lojban word order, I felt this word would be closer to ""cooking"" as it was in A than in B so I felt this confirmed the translator and A is the better translation.

The pages I read (mostly medical websites like NIH) stated that intubation was a great priority because fluid resuscitation might cause the airway to close. Fluid resuscitation could then take place. Among the documents was an NIH treatment protocol for severe burns which places intubation as a priority (particularly for people with neck burns or circumferential burns) with fluid resuscitation to be done urgently but later.

Later, I examined whether the salesperson's committment made a difference and found nothing relevant but still felt that he was making a committment by the employer not his own individual self. 

What I did encounter is that terminations of employment contracts must be in good faith - this is common in contract law. This means that if the court considers that the (persumably) hefty bonus to be paid to the salesperson would be avoided by termination, the court might find the employer was not acting in good faith and may find for the salesperson.

I noticed that both had (for want of a better term) root words zgana and zabna which referred to observation. 

The tricky part was imputing the intent of the English sentence. Was the ""As you saw"" very passive (in which case zgana and ga'a might be better) or was it more exclamatory (which favours zabna or za'a). I was unsure because a lot would depend upon context. Is the speaker trying to say something like, ""You saw! (and I know it so why are you asking?) The snake bit me"" or is it more like, ""As you viewed, a snake bit me"".

I decided that the latter was a better interpretation of the English sentence and therefore favoured zgana and its mutation ""ga'a"". This meant that I felt B was the better translation but either could be argued. ",B,,,,,,,,

However, the intention of the English sentence was unclear.

I searched more on acceptance implied from conduct and found confirming information but didn't really ""hit the spot"" in terms of finding something that was definitive. 

I wanted to look at the other answer and searched for initiated performance for contracts and encountered the terms ""unilateral contracts"" which I searched. After a read-through of what such contracts were, I judged that they applied to this question's situation and looked deeper for how acceptance is communicated. Cornell's LII again provided information but it wasn't until I came across a few possibly less authoritative websites that unilateral contracts require no acceptance but only the offerer is notified once the performance has been completed and not when initiated. One site said explicitly that part performance of a contract made the offer irrevocable.

The adult daughter might fall into that category but she did not want the contract to be enforced. The question remains of whether the senior citizen had capacity to contract but she was taking potent painkillers and even the other party to the contract noticed that she was ""out of sorts"" which indicates she lacked capacity. One website (that of some lawyers) mentioned a specific case like this: If on so much pain medication that you couldn't think clearly, the contract should be voided. 

A later checked for oral changes to oral contracts (as the car purchase appeared to be) and did not find anything that said they could not be enforced. 

With that information, A (that the contract was not written) is unlikely to be sustained by a court because oral agreements are just as valid.

I tried to verify this with more sources but found little. An online translator failed to produce any difference and the translation was different enough from the source sentence to make me distrust it for this task. Lojban might be a language for which the entire sentence needs to be known for a correct translation so I was still unsure about my original research into ""ke'o"" and ""ke'u"" but I felt the weight of evidence (after some more searching for ""krefu"") was in favour of B (the sentence with ""ke'u"" in) to be the more correct translation of the source sentence.

I abandoned the public healthcare sites and focused on sites aimed at medical professionals. The breakthrough was a paper contrasting otitis, sinusistis and mastoiditis. The first two were relatively minor and probably best left to sort themselves out and only a few symptoms were mentioned. Mastoiditis, however, mentioned more of the symptoms (even coming just after antibiotics) and noted that it was a serious infection that required intervention.

I refined the search to see if other trials played a role in this. I changed the word ""exclude"" for ""disqualify"" (excluded was conflating with excluding jurors) and read some documents about impeachment of witnesses. Results were confused with criminal cases so I refined the search again and read a Wikipedia page as a start. 

This page led to a judgement about character evidence being generally inadmissible unless, in addition to character being a substantive issue in the case (which I believe it's not), it's being used to impeach a witness but this did not specify whether experts testifying about something else were included. The case linked to (Pino v Koelber, 1980).

I refined the case again to refer to behaviour in other cases, found little other than Cornell University's Legal Information Institute (LII) discussing rule 608 of the Federal Rules of Evidence which was more about witnesses' character and this suggested that the respondent's claim about the expert witness might be admissible. 

I read a question on the Google page about discrediting an expert witness and a lawyer's own page said there were three grounds to do so, none of which applied to the question. I refined the search again to one about challenging expert witnesses and the LII again came up with the Daubert Standard for expert witnesses. A Wikipedia article did not discuss anything to do with testimony in personal and unrelated cases so I felt that the answer A (the evidence should be omitted because the character of the expert witness is not a substantive part of the case, and there were many grounds for excluding expert witnesses established in Daubert v Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals (1993) which laid out the grounds upon which expert witnesses can be challenged in court.

""Cfari"" meant that something had begun as part of a process. I looked for the other words in the sentence (""ma"": a question, ""lo"": possible the, ""fagri"": fire)to get an idea of word order so the definitions fitted. Both appeared to be quite plausible as translations of ""Who started the fire?"". I felt confident that ""cfagau"" was correct because it fitted in with being a person's action rather than just a process (""Who started...""). 

My next step was to try an online translator which confused the issue. The ""cfari"" version was translated almost correctly but the ""cfagau"" was translating as being subtly different. I tried translating the first two words of each sentence to compare and confirmed. I then translated ""Who started"" into Lojban and got something different altogether, as did entering the entire English sentence though ""cfari"" appeared whereas ""cfagau"" did not. This was in opposition to my earlier conclusion. 

I checked more sources by refining the search back to ""cfagau"" and on one of the pages stated that it was a conjoined word of ""cfari"" and ""gasnu"" CFAri and GAsnU being CFAGAU. Gasnu meant ""to do"" which implied it was to be used when a person began something. The question was whether starting a fire was due to a person or to a process. For some contexts, both could be applied (like starting an engine - did you start the engine? Has the engine started?) but for a fire it felt closer to a person doing an action to begin something. Hence I feel that A. ""ma cfagau lo fagri"" is the better translation.

I searched for treatments of varicoceles. The articles that came back didn't supply much information outside of ""examination"" so I did the same search but added ""NIH"" to get formal papers. The article I read from that search went into so much detail that I was quickly overwhelmed. All I understood was that only 2-10% of patients reported pain.

The information was heavy and sometimes overwhelming but useful in terms of diagnosis and treatment. 

I then compared the treatments of FAST scan and CT scan against each other and refined the search to FAST scan and DPL. This search was refined by adding ""adbominal"" to ensure focus. This led me to information that a CT scan was a good means of aiding diagnosis by locating internal injuries but that it should only be done on hemodynamically normal patients. This patient had signs of weak blood pressure and rapid pulse rate. The DPL on the other hand was invasive but a more sensitive test (more so than a FAST scan) but won't indicate which organs are damaged and can be performed on haemodynamically unstable patients (like this one).

This produced two pages, one from Cornell University's Legal Information Institute (LII) and another more detailed page from a legal firm. These outlined pretty much what the question discussed, that indue influence is when one party exerts ""excessive persuasion on another"" (LII). If the brother can prove that his mother had vulnerabilities that made her liable to persuasion, and that his sister was in a special relationship of trust, then it is likely the court would rule the contract unenforceable and voidable due to undue influence. This made me feel very confident that my initial guess was correct. 

I then searched for ""Insufficient consideration"" and found that it referred to a situation where a contract has been made but the consideration (an essential part of contracts) has become worthless. This did not appear to apply to the house bought by the sister. I checked on a number of sites and was perplexed when the LII did not have anything about this phrase (the nearest was ""failure of consideration"") but I found the phrase defined on other websites (mostly legal firms and educational websites of uncertain provenance). What one article did point out is that there is a concept of ""inadequate consideration"" (like selling a valuable car for $1 which is clearly inadequate) which might apply if the court can be convinced that $100,000 is clearly far too little for a house valued at $250,000 but it could be argued that it's a fair price for a beloved close relative and it's not a trivial amount of money. This came from an educational website rather than that of one of or for legal professionals so I am not confident about this as a formal concept in US contract law. 

Given the strength of answer A (undue influence), I regard this as the most likely reason to invalidate the contract.

I searched instead for click and got a couple of useful pages (one from Brigham and Womens the latter from the International Hip Dysplasia Institute) which both said that hip dysplasia is indeed one diagnosis but most cases were not. An evaluation using tools such as ultrasound and examination would be necessary to confirm this and could well be inconsequential. 

None of this information, however, made is clear which was the next appropriate step. Ultrasound was recommended to be sure (or reassure parents) but it was also likely to be of little to no consequence.

Instead, I began by comparing the status of contract versus gift (as per answer B) and found a formal document called ""gift promises and the edge of contract law"". One key phrase used was ""reliance, moral obligation and irrevocable trusts"" arose in a paragraph that explained that contracts could not include gifts but sometimes promises could be treated like contracts and thus enforceable. 

I searched for this phrase and encountered another heavy document titled, ""Irrevocable gift promises and promises inducing reliance"" which appeared to be relevant. It also explained that some promises could be legally enforceable using the contractual doctrine of ""reliance or promissory estoppel"". This felt like I was on the right lines. 

I searched for this phrase and came across a page on Cornell University's Legal Information Institute about promissory estoppel and gained a definition of what it was, and it was an implied agreement. I followed the link to agreement and found they could be as binding as contracts (often depending upon which state) but the terms needed to be as certain as those of a contract. Given that the company's board had made a formal, signed decree, this can be taken as an agreement. I needed more information about agreements and refined the search by adding the word ""agreement"". 

From this, I got two pages by law firms (both in New York) that explained promissory estoppel in detail and how there were four elements to it. The promise had to exist (the decree fit this), the promise was expected that the recipient would rely on it (he did), that the other party did rely upon it (both qualified by his purchase of a vehicle) and that the injustice cannot be avoided without encorcing the promise (the executive is unemployable now). 

I checked the second page for confirmation and got that but also more information about detrimental reliance. While promissory estoppel is not recognised by all states (for example, Virginia does not but Maryland and D.C. do), the detrimental reliance can be enforceable in those jurisdictions. The elements are much the same as promissory estoppel.

I think that B is not the correct answer because while the pension is a gift and, because of a lack of consideration from the former executive, cannot be a contract, the fact that he relied upon it and needs to continue to do so to prevent the injustice of paying for his vehicle leads me to say A. is the likely result in court.

The breakthrough came when I encountered a page on Cornell University's Legal Information Institute which used the phrase ""open time"" in relation to payments. It also contained a list of four principles, the first of which was that unless otherwise stated, ""payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goodseven though the place of shipment is the place of delivery"". This strongly favours answer B rather than A. After searching some more, I discovered that for the sale of goods, there is legislation in most US jurisdictions called the ""Uniform Commercial Code 2"". It's been adopted by 49 states (except Louisiana although that has adopted most of it) and a few non-state jurisdictions like the D.C., Guam, and the Navajo Nation which adopted a number of articles (the provision outlined above is in article 3). 

Because the contract of sale does not specify any delivery location or payment date, it's fair to assume that the Uniform Commcercial Code 2's point a) above applies and the most correct interpretation is B, that the goods must be paid for on delivery. 

There might be a difference because only part of the goods have been supplied but this was beyond my searching. My gut feel is, however, that what is delivered must be paid for then and there unless the contract specifies otherwise.

I entered more symptoms until peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was mentioned and I read a lot of public-facing websites. They offered some information but little useful detail for diagnosis, treatment or first steps. After more searches, the NIH had a very detailed article (aimed at healthcare professionals) where a lot of signs and symptoms matched including risk factors (smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, increased age)pain occurring when walking, the extremities being painful when lying down (ischemic rest pain) and the loss of pulses. Symptoms of pain in the calf muscles suggest aortoiliac artery occlusive disease leading to femoropopliteal PAD.

In terms of next steps, antibiotics are only recommended if the ulcer is infected (i.e., with pus). If not, it may be washed with an antibiotic solution (answer B specifies oral antibiotics) but angiography is a commonly mentioned tool for diagnosis.

I searched for a definition of each and found that they both referred to location: bu'u being described as ""coincident with or at the same location as..."" which felt like it fit the sentence (which referred to the Hadj and Meccah). ne'i instead appeared to be a reference to being within or inside. This also fit well as I was unsure which might be correct. I checked a few more pages, one was very long and featured examples of both words but I was none the clearer for reading it: Both words appeared to be good translations. I tried a English-Lojban translator, first beginning with the English sentence which offered nothing useful. I then interpreted A and B to English and got the same answer. Either, it appears, would work. 

I then noticed that both words were conjugates of other words: bukpu for bu'u and nenri for ne'i and examined their definitions. Nenri continued to mean within/inside but bukpu changed to mean a measure of cloth! This didn't fit. 

For the final answer, I checked through some more search listings but found nothing that would answer the question. My guess is that despite bukpu meaning something different, bu'u referring to something being in the same place appeared to be a better translation. I have, however, a very low confidence in either being better than the other and think both would be fine enough translations.

If the LEO's testimony is under question, I began by reading about hearsay. Cornell University's Legal Information Institute has a nice introductory page about hearsay and it is generally inadmissible because the credibility of the witness cannot be established in the court (if they did give testimony in court, it is not hearsay). There are exceptions to hearsay but none of them appear to apply outside of a possible ""excited utterance"". If the court deems the co-passenger's statement as such, then it is an exception to hearsay and would be admissible. Other exceptions include statements against self (not relevant because the co-passenger is not the defendant), and matter of record (the statement is not an official record of the type referred to). Even if there is no exception, judges may rule hearsay evidence as admissible. 

I then investigated relevance and read a paper from Indiana University's Maurer School of Law that said relevance comes with two tests (rule 401). The first is that it must prove or disprove a fact and the statement appears to be probative towards the defendants being intoxicated. The second is that the fact must be a consequence in determining the action and the defendant's intoxication while driving appears to be relevant here. From this, I concluded that B (not admissible because it's nonessential and irrelevant) does not apply because it appears to directly confirm the actual charge made by the prosecution. 

I'm still baffled as to why either of these answers is likely because I don't think they are. In my opinion, if the co-passenger is willing to testify, then the issue of hearsay falls away and even if not, their statement may be taken as an ""excited utterance"" and admissible. However, I think the most likely grounds of exclusion is A, that of hearsay because I don't see B as relevant.

I examined the sentences and noticed two main differences: A used zmanei whereas B used nalmau; and after that, the word order changed. I could see that ""la .mark"" referred to ""Mark"" in the English sentence just as ""la .djein"" referred to Jane so they appeared straightforward. I searched for word order in Lojban to see if that gave me a clue as to the better translation. The document I found (Wikipedia) said that word order is free so there was no clue as to whether A or B was the best translation. I

My next step was to translate zmanei and nelmau. Zmanei was easy to discover and had multiple agreeing translations (preference of a person for one item over another) which is in the ball park of the translation and probably understandable. It was, however, not perfect. Problems began when I tried to translate nelmau and got nothing other than some words in email signatures on a mailing list of Lojban enthusiasts. This did not help and only found one source. Even my regular sources of Lojban words dried up. I was tempted to abandon here because perhaps nelmau was not a word and A (""zmanei"") would win by default. The only clue I had was a Lojban -> Occitan translator that used Nelmau but I don't understand Occitan. I copied the Occitan translation and translated it, in turn, into English and nelmau did indeed appear to relate to preference. One step closer but nowhere near enough. 

The translator I prefer (vlasisku.lojban.org) had nothing for nelmau but it was being used by some people. Aftr trying it again, I noticed that despite vlasisku saying it found nothing, it linked to two other words: ""nelci"" and ""zmadu"". Connecting those two could result in ""nelmau"" (NELci zMAdU) and searched for translations of those words. They key decider was that ""nelci"" referred to preference but in a slightly different way to Zmanei. Zmanei felt like one person saying they preferred this item over this item - it's close but not quite. With Nelmau, it was more of a fondness/has a taste for and zmadu referred to is more in a type of property. This felt (though I was not confident) that it was the correct answer by stating that Mark had a taste for tea that exceeded the taste for tea that Jane had.

I examined the translations of each word individually and found that tavla was translated mostly as ""talk"" but in a fairly context-free sense. I talk, I talked, I was talking. It could imply a conversation but also imply a monologue. The English sentence uses ""talk"" in the sense of a discussion so while tavla felt like a good enough word, it wasn't the complete picture. 

Searching for translations of Casnu, on the other hand, showed it to be translated as discussion. This felt closer to the meaning of the original English sentence where the object was a conversation between the speaker and another party. Casnu felt much closer to the original sentence's meaning. After looking at some examples of both words, I again felt that casnu was a better translation and might even put a partial English -> English translation of the original sentence from ""What we talked about is very important to both of us."" to ""What you and I discussed had elements of importance to all parties to the discussion."" With this, the answer sentence with casnu (B) feels like it's a better translation that the sentence with tavla though both could be used.

Part of misrepresentation is when there is an intentional or reckless misrepresentation of fact or opinion with an intention to make a party do or not do something (in this case agree to the sale).

After searching through the Federal Trade Commission website, I discovered something called the ""used car rule"" that states that it is a deceptive act or practice to misrepresent the mechanical condition of a used vehicle. 

Clearly, the buyer would have a good possibility of winning their case; but why? The dealer has deliberately made misleading statements and hidden evidence of the accident and that is a deceptive practice indeed, but the key point of law is that in doing so, the dealer has made the contract unconscionable and therefore oppressively unfair. My answer is therefore B.

There were a few question-and-answer type sites such as Quora that offered opinions that they could and the search engine itself suggested answers. I preferred to rely upon a more authoritative source aimed at legal professionals. My first result was a library of criminal justice resources which stated that children do attend criminal courts to give evidence as witnesses and victims (the child was both but I'm presuming we're talking about the child being a witness for a homicide trial only). This article only contained an abstract and insufficient information to determine the most likely reason for the court's decision, only that they could be allowed. 

My next result was Cornell's Legal Information Institute that said children are presumed to be competent and that Rule 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence contained information about witness competence. Examinations for competence could be undertaken but only if a party offers a written motion supported by an offer of proof of incompetence. Without this, the child witness is presumed to be competent and no examination can be done. The question does not state that such evidence exists and I assumed that it does not. This disqualifies answer B, that witness competence must be proven - it is presumed by the court. 

I searched more pages to clarify this including rule 602 of the Federal Rules of Evidence (the need for personal knowledge) which applies to all witnesses, child or adult. The presence of the child during the death of the father allows this to be presumed also. Therefore, my answer is A, that the child will be allowed because their age is no bar to offering testimony; that they have personal knowledge of the incident and qualify as a non-expert witness; and that there is no evidence offered of the witness' lack of competence to be a witness so the court presumes that the child can offer testimony.",A,,,,,,,,

I went back to the example sentences containing ""cu cmoni"" and ""co'a cmoni"" and found some interesting ones related to wolves. The former referred to wolves howling without anything else.

They may present more difficulty because they are more often harder to prove than written ones. However, I began my search by looking for more information about oral contracts. The first page i looked at (Cornell's Legal Information Institute) confirmed that they were indeed just as valid except that they may fail under something called the ""Statute of Frauds"" in each state. In the cases under this statute, contracts had to be in writing. Mention was made of contracts to secure long lease periods or for another's performance to be complete in the distant future (but the lengths of time were unspecified). I examined the linked-to page but there was no more specificity. I searched for the ""us statute of frauds"" and opened two pages: One from a lawyer's company and Wikipedia. The former specified that the lease period had to be less than one year for an oral contract to be valid (the agreement included a lease for 4 months), and that the agreement had to be completed within a year (the student graduated within the year). This meant the oral contract could be maintained. 
 
 Within the statute, however, is the requirement that contracts that agree to pay the debt of another need to be written. This presents difficulty because although the overall agreement does just this (the father pays the student's debt), the claim the student makes is actually for living costs. The court may decide that this debt payment means the entire agreement has to be written but they may also decide that it's separate enough not to require a written contract. 
 
 There was another point about being in the lifetime of the promisor but I anticipated this meant that the completion should be expected within the promisor's lifetime; his sudden death should not be a relevant point. 
 
 Because of these, I felt that the oral contract was valid and that a written contract was not required by law so the student would have a successful claim (answer B), as long as the student can prove the existence of the contract terms. ",B,,,,,,,,

This definition was ""turn/rotate/towards direction"" which sounded approximate but felt more like a spin when the English sentence could be more precise by using ""transformed"" instead of ""turn"".

Xunre meant red, tamca was tomato and co'a meant beginning or starting something.

I then tried a translator beginning with the English sentence which led nowhere useful; so I tried the two sentences which were similar but did not specify the tomato being red as a transformation (turning red) but just one day (one said ""One day the flesh becomes red."", the other ""The tomato turns red one day."").

I followed a link to a page about matters of record which included findings of fact, evidence, motions, rulings, verdicts and testimony. Hearsay is normally inadmissible because the witness cannot be examined sufficiently; but in a prior trial, they already have been examined on the matter. I further searched for verification and read about rules 803 and 804 governing exceptions to hearsay (803) and dealing with hearsay when the declarant is unavailable, and both supported the earlier information. 

Because of this, answer B is not possible: The security guard's testimony in his manslaughter trial is a matter of record and is therefore not hearsay and is admissible. This means that A is most likely the correct answer.

Contracts for selling real estate , 
Contracts for selling securities

Contracts that cannot be performed within one year from the date of the agreement 
Contracts in which one party agrees to pay someone else’s debt

Undue influence can be used to argue against the formation of a contract and is common in will dispute cases and in elder abuse. If a person has used excessive persuasion over another leading to a contract that only benefits them this can be seen as undue influence. The influenced person would usually have a vulnerability, in this scenario the mother is dying and the daughter has threatened isolation if she does not agree to the arrangement. The influencer is also usually in a special relationship of trust and the person is dependent on the influencer, in this case the mother would have trust and dependency on the daughter. If this can be established then the contract can be voided.

I found three different law firms in different states two of which seemed to confirm that the company was more liable to win than the employee but it’s a complex area and made more difficult by individual federal and state laws.

Yusuf Butar, employment law advisers, stress the need for clear contracts that comprehensively address all the different nuances of commission payments.

Garrison Law in Connecticut go a lot further. They say there are three separate issues which need to be considered over payment of commissions after termination. These are:

1.	Under Connecticut law it’s not unlawful for an employer to terminate the contract of an employee to avoid paying outstanding commissions.

2.	The definition of a ‘wage’ has to be formally specified in the contract. You don’t get your commission until the client pays their bill, and if you’re not employed when the client pays their bill, you don’t get it, then the client paying their bill and your continued employment on that date are conditions precedent to the existence of a wage. For a wage to be classed as such it can be conditional on whether you’re still employed, and whether the client has paid their bill. 

3.	The third point, slightly more weighted in the employee’s favour says: The covenant of good faith and fair dealing is implied into every contract, whether it’s written or verbal — at least in Connecticut, but I think everywhere. Put simply employers can’t just use their discretion to avoid paying commissions as this would be seen as bad faith.

In the US being clear on federal and state law is vital in areas like this, where even after clarification there still seem to be inconsistencies. For example, issue 3 appears to be in direct contravention of issue 1. It’s for this reason that I lowered my marking for whether a or B was correct.

Any contract has to include:

1. An offer
An offer of some sort of good or service must be made by one party. 

2. Acceptance of the offer

4. A law-abiding purpose
The reason for the contract needs to be lawful and not for an illegal act.

5. Law-abiding consideration
Something of value needs to be exchanged between those involved in the agreement. Eg. a service and money

6. The terms must be certain
The terms of the agreement have to be clear and understandable. 

7. All parties must agree on their own free will

However additionally if a service or goods are being provided which have a greater value than $500 then a written contract is required.

Often verbal contracts are limited to simpler transactions of smaller value such as:

1.	Small and personal transactions: Eg. buying a second-hand item, such as a used TV from a friend. Unlikely to need a written agreement.

2.	Low value short-term or informal arrangements: When it comes to informal arrangements or short-term agreements, such as babysitting or pet-sitting.

3.	Trusted relationships: In some instances, verbal agreements can work well in relationships that have well-established trust, such as those between parents and adult children or longstanding friends.

In the example, the construction company was negligent from the outset in only relying on a verbal contract in the full knowledge the value of the services was $200,000. The construction company and the customer had a duty of care to protect the transaction with a fully documented and witnessed contract. Even if they were friends the value of the job is high enough to warrant proper documentation and contract. As such, any subsequent complications, such as reintroducing the pavement as a part of the service can’t be considered as part of the contract because the contract was wholly inadequate in the first place.

In this case, the account the plaintiff gave in the hospital was a first-hand account and he clearly couldn’t attend court because he died. These are two of the requirements for acceptability. However, the plaintiff was also fully aware of his impending death because of the accident, which converted his affidavit into a ‘dying declaration’.

This sentence clearly sums up the situation: A statement from an unavailable declarant is not barred by the hearsay rules if the statement was made when the declarant believed that death was imminent and the statement concerned the cause or circumstances of the declarant’s impending death.

Originally the dying declaration ruling also stated: The former statute on dying declarations also required that the declarant must have been in actual danger at the time of the statement, and must have died as a result, but those requirements are not included in the current rule.

Overall, the affidavit appears to be admissible to the court because it was a first-hand account and he subsequently died so couldn’t appear in court. Further, the plaintiff repeatedly complained of his imminent death making his statement a dying declaration.

Correct split: Urethra 25% and Bladder 75%

In a high-speed collision, a direct blow to a distended bladder commonly by a seat belt can result in intraperitoneal injury. This is a serious injury with significant morbidity that often occurs with other injuries in the local area. The bladder is located in the anterior pelvis in an adult. The dome is covered by the peritoneum, and the bladder neck is fixed to the pelvis by fascia and ligaments. A gross hematuria is a typical symptom as is tenderness around the lower abdomen.

In a similar accident where the urethra is injured, the pelvis is frequently fractured at the same time. In the urethral trauma, the urethra is often severed when the pelvis fractures and needs to be reconnected. The second type of urethral trauma is called a straddle injury, such as when someone is riding a bike, slips and lands heavily on the crossbar between their legs.

The symptoms of urethral trauma don’t include a hematuria and consequently, this injury is much more likely to be to the bladder dome.

When considering whether to allow a prior conviction into evidence, judges must decide if the conviction's value in helping the jury assess the defendant's truthfulness outweighs its potential for prejudice, where the defendant’s reputation suffers.

Under O.C.G.A. § 24-4-404(b), evidence of other acts can be introduced by the prosecution to prove a defendant’s “motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.”  This type of evidence is only admissible if the State shows:

(1) that it seeks to introduce the evidence not to raise an improper inference as to the defendant’s character but for some proper purpose.

(2) that there is sufficient evidence to establish that the defendant committed the independent offense

(3) that there is a sufficient connection or similarity between the independent offense and the crime charged so that proof of the former tends to prove the latter.” Amica v. State, 704 S.E.2d 831 (Ga.App. 2010).

Similar transaction evidence can be one of the largest hurdles facing a criminal defendant.  Although the judge tells the jury that all this evidence about the other crime cannot be used to determine the guilt for the crime that the defendant is on trial for, that is not a reality. Evidence of prior crimes will almost always create some bias in the minds of jurors.

To establish a violation of Fraud and False Statements section 7206(1) such as falsifying accounts, the court must establish the following four elements occurred beyond a reasonable doubt:

1.	 Making and subscribing a return, statement, or other document which was false in material matters.

2.	 The return, statement, or other document contained a written declaration that was made under the penalties of perjury.

3.	The defendant did not believe the return, statement, or other document to be true and correct as to every material matter.

4.	The defendant falsely subscribed to the return, statement, or other document wilfully, with the specific intent to break the law.

So, previous similar accusations or convictions can be admitted to the court as evidence however the evidence is subjective in that it can’t help but raise suspicions in the mind of the judge and jury.

Initially, I thought the likelihood was that the defendant was guilty because previous evidence of a similar crime was being submitted to court. However, on reflection without hearing the defendants defence about how the submission was faulty it is impossible to conclude anything but 50:50 between A and B.

In the US, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) governs commercial agreements like contracts for the sale of goods and services. Some states made modifications to certain UCC requirements, so state statutes and common law concerning commercial contracts vary among states, so a careful analysis of the state law governing the contract is vital.

In the example, the location of delivery and the terms of payment are both silent or not included.

According to UCC requirements if the location delivery isn’t specified then the delivery should be made to the buyer's head office. Under the terms of payment when not specified in the contract the default UCC regulation states that payment should be made on the same day as delivery.

Ideally, contracts which are for substantially more than $500, such as this one, should be governed by a clear and full contract between buyer and seller.

On the basis of these two factors B is the correct answer.

Performance on a contract means doing what you're obligated to do under the contract. In the case of contracts for the sale of goods, the basic obligation is that the seller delivers the goods and the buyer pays for the goods.

UCC article 2 goes further and provides specific rules relating to shipments and deliveries of goods, as well as to payment. Additionally, under Article 2, you'll find the following rules:

•	a rule that certain risks and burdens can be divided between the seller and buyer
•	a rule that a valid contract doesn't necessarily need to include a price term 
•	a rule regarding whether and how an order for goods can be delivered in several lots 
•	a set of rules regarding warranties.

Two definitions of undue influence include:

Undue influence occurs when a fiduciary or confidential relationship exists in which one person substitutes his own will for that of the influenced person’s will. 

In 2014, California law was amended to address this problem “excessive persuasion that causes another person to act or refrain from acting by overcoming that person’s free will and results in inequity.” 

The effect of undue influence needs to include these four elements:

•	Vulnerability of the victim
•	Apparent authority of the influencer
•	Actions or tactics used by the influencer
•	Equity of the result - who is to gain or lose


Insufficient consideration in dealing with family estates uses similar principles as applied in contract law in the US. It can be summarised as: ‘That is, one party provides something of value to the other party to induce a promise from the other party or to induce performance from the other party.’ The accusation of insufficient consideration comes about when one party argues that the value that it provided the other party is greater than the value it was provided in return.  Therefore, the consideration was inadequate.

Comparing the evidence of undue influence and insufficient consideration to the example of the daughter and mother the former is much more clear. For example, the vulnerability of the mother is apparent as she is receiving end of life care. Secondly, the daughter promoted herself as the more responsible of the two children so she did have more authority but only in her mind. Thirdly the tactics the daughter used to coerce her mother were underhand. She threatened to stop visiting if her mother didn’t accede. Lastly, the equity was unfair. The mother wanted both children to have equal shares of the estate and the daughter’s proposition would have altered this considerably.

The evidence for insufficient consideration is less clear although the equity of the new family estate result would prove grounds for insufficient consideration. There was surprisingly little online information about insufficient consideration in the context of family estates.

The reduced brachial and radial pulses on the left side suggest there is a blockage in the subclavian artery on that side while the right-hand side is okay. Similarly, a bruit above the left clavicle could also be an indicator demonstrating the turbulence of blood flow in the artery caused by a partial blockage.

The different types of subclavian artery disease include the following symptoms:

1.	A lower blood pressure reading in one arm compared to the other.
2.	Discoloration in your arm or hands.
3.	Numbness, tingling, weakness or pain in your arm.

Option A suggests that the systolic blood pressure between left and right arms would be the same. However, the above information suggests the opposite where, the narrowing of the subclavian artery would lower the pulses in the left arm.

Option B suggests inserting a stent in the left subclavian artery. This would help to reduce the narrowing of the artery and improve blood flow. Consequently, B is much more likely to be the better option.

In ‘B’ the property owner’s right to assign the lease to a new party is solely under the discretion of the property owner. Even though details of the property owner's decision on the assignation of the business is included in the contract both the uncle and the nephew don’t have any say in how it is assigned.

A defendant in a civil or criminal prosecution who voluntarily testifies
at trial waives his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.
Unlike the ordinary witness, the accused cannot be compelled to
answer any question; but once he has taken the stand and
testified on his behalf, he may be cross-examined like an ordinary
witness. Questions which elicit an incriminating response are then no
longer barred by the Fifth Amendment privilege, for the defendant's
waiver removes the constitutionally prohibited element of compulsion.

This waiver rule has been justified on two grounds:

Firstly, a defendant should not be allowed to present his side
of his own story to the jury without cross-examination designed to discover and correct any distortion of the truth.

Additionally, when a defendant has given substantial testimony, he would find
little, if any, protection by claiming the privilege. By this time, policies
of disclosure are thought to outweigh the privilege.

Cases concerning self-incrimination apply to both civil and criminal proceedings. However, there are differences in the civil case, because the jury may be allowed to draw certain inferences from the refusal to testify, and the defendant may be barred from presenting certain evidence.

So, B is much more likely to be correct, as the woman relinquished her 5th Amendment right by choosing to testify voluntarily.

Consequently, US law on this topic is changing rapidly and still varies significantly from state to state.

For example, some states rule that children are incompetent unless they understand the nature of an oath. Likewise, some states rule that children below certain ages, usually 10, 12, or 14, are presumed incompetent unless determined otherwise however no minimum age exists for children's testimony.

To testify, a child must have certain characteristics, which include:

•	the capacity to observe
•	sufficient intelligence
•	adequate memory
•	the ability to communicate
•	awareness of the difference between truth and falsehood
•	an appreciation of the obligation to tell the truth.


Witnesses are questioned to decide their competence to testify under a voir dire examination, which is usually held to determine whether a child is competent. The trial judge has substantial discretion regarding the conduct of this examination. The burden of proof rests on the party challenging the child's capacity to testify. Attorneys should carefully prepare children for the competency examination

In this case, the child is 4 years old and has been traumatised by the attack. Developmentally, although 3- to 4-year-olds are more likely to label anything that is not true as a lie, older children can distinguish between a mistake and intentional misrepresentation. Given that many children lie spontaneously in experimental situations that have no immediate consequences for the child, it is not surprising that under coercive situations, especially if asked by a parent or authority figure to do so, children will lie. This is a compelling argument for not allowing such a young witness to testify and for the fact that very young children may be incapable of providing a coherent version of events.

That said the only testimony required from the young witness in this case is to confirm or deny that the accused who held the gun is the same man as in the court.

The difference between A & B comes down to the degree of accuracy of the child’s testimony. A demands only ‘sufficient grounds’ while B demands ‘compelling evidence’. As the witness is of such a young age B therefore has to be the better choice.

Goods or services being sold for more than $500.00 should have a written contract however as this car was being sold for $450.00 then a written contract isn’t necessarily required.

However, when selling a car, a Bill of Sale does protect sellers by documenting the sale and transfer of ownership to the buyer. In many states, the sale of a vehicle is not final until the buyer has obtained a new title displaying their ownership.

In terms of capacity for a contract to be legally binding, all individuals who sign must have ‘contractual capacity.’ This refers to the minimum mental capacity required to enter into an agreement. Individuals who lack the capacity to contract are presumed to not know what they're doing, and they can void, or set aside, the contract.

However, if a party is so far gone as to be unable to understand even the nature and consequences of the agreement, and the other (sober) party takes advantage of the person's condition, then the contract may be voidable by the inebriated party. In this case the neighbour knew the seller had been in hospital and knew the seller was acting strangely, as well as knowing the true value of her car.

The law recognizes three categories of individuals who lack the capacity to contract:

•	minors
•	individuals with psychological disabilities
•	intoxicated persons

If anyone from these categories enters into a contract, the agreement might be considered voidable by them. This protects the party who lacks capacity from being forced to go through with a deal that takes advantage of his or her lack of savvy.

States use different tests to determine whether a person has the mental capacity to form a contract.

There are different ""cognitive"" tests.

The affective test. Some states use what's called the ""affective test"": A contract can be voided if one party is unable to act in a reasonable manner and the other party has reason to know of the condition.

The motivational test. Courts measure capacity by the person's ability to judge whether or not to enter into the agreement. These tests can produce varying results when applied to mental conditions such as bipolar disorder.

So overall the seller is well within her rights to void the contract.

‘If I do not receive a response by January 25, I will assume that you consent to this arrangement.’ The landlord, without responding to the father's letter, did not evict the student.

The landlord by default agrees to not evict son

Verbal contracts can be legally binding, but there are exceptions and verbal contracts are harder to verify and prove. Like written contracts, verbal contracts must include the elements of a valid contract to be enforceable and legally binding:

1.	Offer and acceptance – the father agrees to finance the son’s allowance and rent, and the son accepts.

2.	Consideration – they both agreed the money was provided for rent and the son’s allowance.

3.	Legality – the contract needs to be legal

4.	Capacity – the father & son must clearly understand the obligations, terms, and consequences of the contract before they sign

The agreement between the father and son was verbal and the value of the son’s claim is relatively low ($800.00) even if this is a little over the threshold limit of $500.00 in contract law. There is no indication that the son is a beneficiary of the estate or even if there was a will. Consequently, as the required elements of the contract were present even though it’s a verbal contract it should still hold, so B is the more likely correct answer.

If your patient is currently pregnant; and had two previous deliveries she is G3 P2

Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a problem with the way a baby's hip joint forms. Sometimes the condition starts before the baby is born, and sometimes it happens after birth, as the child grows. It can affect one hip or both. Often when the hip is manipulated it makes a popping or clicking sound.

This is because the hip does not form well. The ball part of the joint may be completely, or partly, out of the socket. Sometimes the ball part may slide in and out of the socket and often, the socket is shallow. It needs fixing or the hip joint will not grow well. Any baby can have DDH but it is more prevalent in girls.

Symptoms of DDH include:

•	The baby's hips make a popping or clicking that is heard or felt.
•	The baby's legs are not the same length.
•	One hip or leg doesn't move the same as the other side.
•	The skin folds under the buttocks or on the thighs don't line up.
•	The child has a limp when starting to walk.

An ultrasound is a common way of assessing the baby's hip joint. This works best with babies under 6 months of age because most of a baby's hip joint is still soft cartilage, which won't show up on an X-ray. X-rays are used for assessment in older patients.

There are several treatment options available which should solve the problem without lasting complications. It might be necessary to have checkups with a specialist to ensure the hip is developing correctly.

As the baby is a girl and the distinctive popping sound has been noted then option B, ultrasound screening is the best choice.

Subcostal retractions: Indrawing of the abdomen just below the rib cage (sometimes referred to as belly breathing).

Perioral cyanosis – blue lips caused by lack of oxygen

A - Diffuse interstitial pulmonary lung disease refers to a group of lung disorders that affect the interstitium, which is the connective tissue or sac which is the support structure of the alveoli (air sacs) of the lungs. Normally when you inhale, the air sacs fill with air and oxygen passes into the blood stream. When you exhale, carbon dioxide that passed from the blood into the air sacs breathed out. With interstitial lung disease, the lung becomes inflamed and stiff, preventing the air sacs from fully expanding. This limits the delivery of oxygen to the blood stream and the removal of carbon dioxide from the body, causing strained breathing – subcostal retractions and blue lips. As the disease progresses, the interstitium thickens, which further impedes lung function.

B - A double bubble sign in newborn infants can be seen on X-ray, where it has various causes. It shows as two air-filled structures in the upper abdomen and represents a gas-distended dilated stomach and duodenum, suggesting bowel obstruction. Diagnosis and treatment varies with each different type of double bubble sign.

A is the more likely outcome in this case. This is based on symptoms including:

•	Subcostal retractions – the baby is struggling to breathe because of the fluid in the lungs.

•	Perioral cyanosis and a low oxygen saturation of 86% - not enough oxygen is getting through the lungs.

•	This condition is not unusual in young infants

DPL plays a role in both blunt and penetrating abdominal trauma.

Both CT scanning and DPL is indicated in both blunt and a selective group of penetrating abdominal injuries. In blunt injuries, DPL has several indications but is dependent upon the patient's condition and the availability of CT scanning and focused abdominal sonography for trauma (FAST). DPL is useful for patients who are in shock and when FAST capability is not available. However, patients, such as the example, with low blood pressure should not be evaluated with CT scanning and DPL is also useful in patients with an unreliable abdominal exam due to altered mental status, like the patient’s concussion.

FAST exams are rapid, non-invasive, and can be repeated multiple times throughout the resuscitation period. They are more user-dependent than DPL or CT scanning. Both FAST and DPL ineffectively evaluate retroperitoneal and diaphragmatic injuries and poorly identify solid organ injuries. Abdominopelvic CT scanning still requires a hemodynamically normal patient, is costly.

So, on the basis the patient has low blood pressure and concussion, it’s best if he is assessed with DPL rather than a CT scan.

This case presents the question of whether the use of a thermal-imaging device aimed at a private home from a public street to detect relative amounts of heat within the home constitutes a “search” within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

Police were investigating suspected indoor marijuana growing, which typically requires high-intensity lamps. To determine whether the amount of heat emanating from the petitioner’s home was consistent with the use of such lamps, police used a thermal imager to scan the property.

However, they fell foul of the Fourth Amendment which provides that “the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.” “At the very core” of the Fourth Amendment “stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.”

In the example, the business owner is protecting his property from illegal intruders using thermal imaging cameras. As the cameras are on his land and so long as they don’t point to any private properties beyond the boundary of his business premises then he is entitled to make infrared recordings for security purposes.

Consequently, B is the more accurate answer as a is referring to the infringement of personal liberty on private land.

This has serious consequences as the inelastic burned skin has the potential to constrict the underlying tissues and airways, especially with fluid retention. As the burn surrounds the neck there is a possibility the burned skin might contract sufficiently to restrict the airways.

Low blood pressure and a high pulse rate can be a sign of shock which would be expected in 43% burns.

Extensive burns invariably result in severe changes in heart and organ function known as burn shock. Shock is an abnormal physiologic state in which fluid transport in tissue is insufficient for oxygen and nutrient delivery and cellular waste removal. Consequently, the blood becomes thicker. The consequences of a severe burn are profound and result in complex metabolic changes that can adversely affect every organ system

Stabilisation of burn victims in terms of priority includes stabilising respiration, fluid resuscitation, cardiovascular stabilization, pain control, and local management of burn wounds.

Although constriction of the neck can quickly lead to asphyxiation this priority has to be balanced with the threat of major fluid loss. Inserting an endotracheal tube (A) and then quickly counteracting fluid loss (B) are the best courses of action.

It means an infection behind your eardrum. This kind of ear infection can happen after any condition that keeps fluid from draining from the middle ear. Connected to the middle ear is your eustachian tube, which drains fluid into the back of your throat and ventilates the middle ear space. An infection can cause the eustachian tube to swell and block fluid from draining or allow negative pressure to build up. These conditions include allergies, a cold, a sore throat, or a respiratory infection. Middle-ear infections are common in children, but they can also happen in adults.

Infections can affect the middle ear in several ways. They are:

1.        Acute otitis media. This middle-ear infection occurs suddenly. It causes swelling and redness. Fluid and mucus become trapped inside the ear. You can have a fever and ear pain.

2.        Otitis media with effusion. Fluid (effusion) and mucus build up in the middle ear after the infection goes away. You may feel like your middle ear is full. This can continue for months and may affect your hearing.

3.        Chronic otitis media with effusion. Fluid (effusion) remains in the middle ear for a long time. Or it builds up again and again, even though there is no infection. This type of middle-ear infection may be hard to treat. It may also affect your hearing.

As the fluid builds up in the middle ear, viruses or bacteria can grow, causing an infection in the middle ear. Children have narrower and shorter eustachian tubes than adults, making them more prone to ear infections.

The 6-year-old still has a temperature even after anti-biotics, which may be caused by the otitis media flaring up again or another middle ear complication such as:

•        Polyps of the middle ear

•        Destruction of bones in the middle ear

A quitclaim deed makes no assurance that the grantor actually has an ownership interest in a property; it merely states that if the grantor does, they release those ownership rights.
Quitclaim deeds are typically used to transfer property in non-sale situations, such as transfers of property between family members.

To create a binding contract with Xavier to sell the land to him she needs to have ownership. In the probate is proven that Zane was indeed the owner. Even though a quitclaim deed had been arranged Zoe, as the grantor, doesn’t have ownership of the land so the quitclaim is irrelevant in this context. As such all they created between them was a void contract as such all they created was a void contract because Zoey didn’t disclose the material fact that she wasn’t the legal owner of the land.

Although qualified as hearsay and therefore consequently inadmissible, testimony (any transcript purchased from a court reporter or downloaded from CM/ECF or PACER is a certified copy) at a former trial may still be admitted into evidence in a subsequent proceeding so long as four conditions are met: 

1.	The witness must be unavailable to testify. A witness is unavailable if he is dead; out of the jurisdiction; insane, sick, or unable to testify; kept away by connivance, collusion, or consent of the other party; or cannot be found after a diligent search.
In the example, the security guard

2.	The second is that the parties be substantially the same – in the example the parties were essentially the same.

3.	The third is that, the two proceedings must involve substantially the same issues – one was a criminal trial and one a civil trial but essentially the same.

4.	Finally, the party against whom the evidence is offered must have had the opportunity to have cross-examined the witness at the earlier proceeding. He need not have done so; he merely had to have had the opportunity to do so. Although it’s not stated presumably there was an opportunity to cross-examine the witness previously.

It must be said this area of law is complex and there are exceptions to the general rule, further complicated by individual state law interpretations. In some states, testimony given at a criminal trial cannot be used against the criminal defendant in a civil lawsuit involving the same incident, even though the witness is dead or otherwise unavailable because courts in these states have concluded that the parties and the issues in the criminal and civil case were not substantially similar.

Hearsay is defined as:

A party offers evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.
Hearsay evidence is typically considered unreliable because it has not been made under oath or subjected to cross-examination. However, there are exceptions where hearsay can be admitted.

Co-Conspirator Exception

The co-conspirator exception reads:

A statement that meets the following conditions is not hearsay:

A statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.  However, its application has been controversial in some cases, as the exception can allow for the admission of statements that might otherwise be considered unreliable.

To admit a co-conspirator’s statement under this rule, such as the wife in this case, the following criteria must be met:

Existence of a Conspiracy
The court must find that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered. This does not mean that the conspiracy must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but there must be sufficient evidence to demonstrate its existence. However, although the friend’s wife heard her husband say, ""I received payment to start the fire."", the wife made no statement to corroborate her involvement in the fire.

Statement Made During the Course of the Conspiracy
The statement must have been made while the conspiracy was ongoing. Statements made after the conspiracy has ended may not be admissible under this rule.

Statement Made in Furtherance of the Conspiracy
The statement must be made to help achieve the goals of the conspiracy. Casual remarks about the conspiracy may not qualify.

Under US law, a declaration against interest is an exception to the rule on hearsay in which a person's statement may be used, where generally the content of the statement is so prejudicial to the person making it that they would not have made the statement unless they believed the statement was true. If a driver in an automobile accident boasts publicly that they were speeding at the time, it may represent a legal admission of liability.

In the example, the plaintiff made his statement not only to his wife but in front of the nurse too, although there is no mention of the nurse being called as a witness.

Consequently, the wife's testimony can be admitted, despite the plaintiff's objection, as it constitutes a declaration against interest. A carries more weight.",A,,,,,,,,

Hearsay is generally inadmissible in legal proceedings because of concerns about its reliability and its potential to introduce unreliable or fabricated evidence into any case. Hearsay testimony involves statements made outside of the courtroom which are not subject to cross-examination, so it can lack the accuracy and truthfulness evident in courtroom testimony.

Exceptions which allow hearsay evidence to be accepted in courtroom testimony:

Unavailable Declarants
If a witness testifies about a statement made by someone who is unavailable to testify, such as a victim who died, their hearsay statement could be admitted under the exception for statements made by unavailable declarants.

Excited Utterances
One exception to the hearsay rule is the admission of excited utterances. These are spontaneous statements made by a person under the influence of a startling event. In injury cases, such statements could include the immediate verbal reactions of a victim describing the event and their injuries. The lack of time for reflection allows for these utterances to be considered reliable and potentially admissible as evidence. In the example, the passenger made the statement about drinking alcohol previously almost as ‘thinking outloud’. It was a spontaneous reaction to the accident and as he was available to testify it could be accepted as an excited utterance.

Present Sense Impressions
Statements that describe an event or condition while the declarant is perceiving it, or immediately thereafter, fall under the present sense impression exception. For instance, in an injury case, a statement made by a witness about the condition of the accident scene or the injured party right after the accident can be deemed admissible as a present sense impression. That is because the impression is perceived and recounted in real-time without significant opportunity for fabrication.

The statement made by the passenger comes under the heading of a hearsay exception of excited utterance. The passenger made the statement still under the stress of
nervous excitement after the accident and it was not the product of studied reflection and possible fabrication. The passenger was available to attend court but excited utterance hearsay is admissible irrespective of whether the witness can or cannot attend court.

Consequently, choice  A doesn’t seem likely as the excited utterance is acceptable as court testimony & with B the statement only confirms that excess alcohol was a contributing factor but that this was unlikely to lead the court towards nonessential, irrelevant topics. So, my only option was to leave the slider at 50:50%.

In many states dealerships that sell used cars need to disclose facts about cars to prospective customers but especially when:

1.	the dealer has exclusive knowledge of material facts about the car’s condition or history that are not reasonably discoverable by you

2.	the dealer has made some representations about the history of the car which would be misleading if the dealership did not disclose material facts about the full history

3.	the dealership has actively concealed material facts about the car’s condition or history from you

4.	the dealership has lied to you about the car’s condition

Dealers can substantially improve their margins by acquiring damaged and repaired used vehicles that have only been in an accident recently. They then sell it on quickly without disclosing the damage to you and before the damage can be logged on the databases of CarFax or AutoCheck, the vehicle history reporting companies. Likewise, a certified quality assurance certificate should detail any previous damage to the car. The customer in this case wasn’t alerted to the previous damage. Additionally, the dealer didn’t disclose information under each of the above headings from 1-4.

Although generally cars sold with a certified quality assurance certificate shouldn’t have any previous history of damage some do get sold. So, it is always the buyer's responsibility to thoroughly check out any claims that have been made.

The case for A is much stronger than B because of the evidence of the seller withholding information about the previous damage and his ‘overselling’ of an average car using words like ‘excellent’ and ‘rigorous inspection process’. In B the accusation of ‘oppressively unfair’ is a much more subjective accusation when compared to the clear-cut accusations of A.",A,,,,,,,,

This is
an accumulation of plaque (fats and cholesterol) in the arteries in the legs or arms. This makes it harder for your blood to carry oxygen and nutrients to the tissues in those areas. PAD is a long-term disease, but you can improve it by exercising, eating less fat and giving up tobacco products.

PAD symptoms can include:

Leg pain when walking – the patient’s calf pain typically occurs after walking for about 10 minutes. This muscle pain in the legs begins with exercise and ends with rest. The typical symptom of PAD is called claudication, a medical term for pain in your leg that starts with walking or exercise and goes away with rest. The pain occurs because your leg muscles aren’t getting enough oxygen.

Muscle pain or cramping in the arms or legs, often in the calf – the patient has occasional calf pain.

Coldness in the lower leg or foot, especially when compared with the other side.

Leg numbness or weakness – the patient has reduced sensation to light touch in both feet.

No pulse or a weak pulse in the legs or feet – the patient has an ankle brachial index (ABI) is 0.3 on the right and 0.7 on the left. This suggests severe PAD in the right foot. Someone with severe PAD could have an ABI between 0.3-0.5. Critical cases have ABI ratios of 0.3 or less.

The patient has high levels of cholesterol, and being diabetic puts him at increased risk of developing PAD, because diabetes worsens high cholesterol levels, a common cause of PAD.

The patient has a history of tobacco use. Tobacco leads to atherosclerosis, the principal cause of PAD This is where plaque narrows arteries, leading to a reduction in blood flow to the limbs.

If plaque or a blood clot narrows or blocks your arteries, blood can’t get through to nourish organs and other tissues. This causes damage ― and eventually death (gangrene) ― to the tissues below the blockage. This happens most often in your toes and feet.

PAD also increases the risk of getting a nonhealing sore or ulcer on your legs or feet, like the patient. In cases of severe PAD, these sores can turn into areas of dead tissue (gangrene) that make it necessary to remove your foot or leg. Ulcers or gangrene are one of the last stages of PAD meaning urgent treatment is required or amputation of the limb might be necessary.",A,,,,,,,,

Most state courts also follow these rules, but not all.

Rule 801 defines hearsay as, “…evidence based not on a witness's personal knowledge but on another's statement not made under oath.”

In the example, the police officer was approached by an anonymous, unidentified driver who said he witnessed the accident involving a cerulean sports car, which he followed to a fast food car park. After speaking with the driver, the officer then saw the same driver in a cerulean sports car in the same fast food car park.

The officer’s statement is out-of-court and it would be subject to a hearsay objection, where the testimony would be stricken or excluded altogether.

The officer’s statement is an oral assertion made out-of-court by a witness who had had time to reflect on the accident, rather than offering a spontaneous account.

If the person who approached the officer had important facts to disclose, why did he remain unidentified? Surely the officer would take his details. The fact that the witness was driving the same style and colour of car as the one he is suggesting was involved in the accident weakens his statement.

The above reasons make it much more likely that the statement would be disallowed as hearsay because it didn’t fall within any of the standard exceptions.

Any such statement won’t be admitted to adversely affect other co-defendants who are accused of the same crime.

Just because a suspect chooses not to answer questions, does not automatically mean that an adverse inference can be drawn. However, if they later put forward an account or explanation (not previously put forward) then an adverse inference provision is triggered.

An adverse inference can be drawn if a suspect is silent during questioning under caution before charge but then subsequently relies on a relevant fact in court, which they could reasonably have been expected to mention when interviewed by police.

An adverse inference may only be drawn where questions have been put to the suspect. Therefore, this section does not apply to a suspect who refused to leave his cell to be interviewed. However, the position would be different if the police had asked questions in the cell.

The admissibility of confessions of a co-defendant is a derivative of the
hearsay rules. These dictate that only if the confessor repeats his accusatory statement in court, and is consequently subject to cross-examination, then it becomes permissible in court and can be used against his accomplice. 

If the co-defendant chooses to acknowledge the confession, rather than remain silent then the statement becomes his own statement of facts rather than evidence or statement of his accomplice. This acknowledgement of confession can be by voluntary affirmance or by silence as an admission of acquiescence. Exposed to such circumstances an innocent person would either make a denial.

The Bruton rule was adopted when one defendant’s confession not only reveals that defendant’s guilt but also, by implication, powerfully incriminates another co-defendant. This leads to a situation where a judge’s limiting instruction to the jury becomes insufficient. Human nature dictates the jury would disregard the instruction and not necessarily come to a truthful conclusion.

In the example, answer A, suggests the confession is admissible. However, the confession was made during questioning and as such is classed as hearsay. Answer B alleges the confession isn’t admissible where the co-defendant is perfectly within his right to remain silent during questioning, so long as he doesn’t rely on evidence he may have withheld later during the trial. Consequently, answer B is the better of the two options.

•	The crime was punishable by death or a prison sentence of greater than 1 year

•	The crime involved fraud or dishonesty

The crime must typically be either a felony or specific misdemeanor offences involving dishonesty, such as fraud. 

The admissibility of such evidence is rigorously controlled, where judges must decide if the previous conviction's value in helping the jury assess the defendant's truthfulness outweighs its potential for prejudice. Evidence of a prior conviction carries a substantial possibility that jurors will presume the defendant has a propensity to commit similar crimes or is a bad person.

Additional protective measures include:

1.	Judges in some states cannot admit evidence about prior convictions unless the defence has already offered evidence to establish the defendant’s credibility.

2.	Prosecutors are usually limited to using evidence of actual convictions alone. They can't question defendants about pending charges or arrests that haven’t resulted in convictions. However, they can question testifying defendants about convictions that are currently on appeal or those where a sentence hasn't yet been imposed.

When assessing prior convictions courts typically consider the following factors:

•	the type of crime

•	whether the crime indicates that the defendant is untruthful

•	how much time has passed since the conviction (convictions that happened 10 years or longer ago are often inadmissible)

•	the length of imprisonment

•	the defendant's age at conviction

•	whether the defendant's credibility is central to the current case

•	the importance of the defendant's testimony in the current case 

•	the defendant's conduct since the prior conviction

As the evidence can be very prejudicial judges won’t usually consider evidence of prior convictions for the same or a similar crime as the one the defendant now faces. As an alternative, courts in many states won't admit very similar prior convictions if the prosecution can find a different prior conviction to impeach the defendant.
Occasionally, however, prior convictions can be used to substantiate the relevance of whether punitive damages are appropriate. 

The court explained that the prior convictions were relevant in that they tended to show that the defendant had not learned his lesson from his two prior convictions.

The evidence of other crimes is appraised using the Cofield Factors to test the eligibility of acceptance of evidence. The following factors are considered: 

•	The evidence of the other crime must be admissible as relevant to a material issue

•	It must be similar in kind and reasonably close in time to the offence charged

•	The evidence of the other crime must be clear and convincing

•	The probative value of the evidence must not be outweighed by its apparent prejudice

Courts need to apply the tests on a case-by-case basis to objectively assess evidence admissibility. 

In the example, the defendant’s prior conviction is an authenticated record although there is no mention of how long ago the offence occurred. Under normal circumstances, the evidence wouldn’t be admissible because the prior conviction was too like the one being tried. Lastly, under the Federal Rule of Evidence Rule 609 certain misdemeanour offences can be included, specifically when they carry a prison sentence of greater than 1 year. In the example, the defendant was let off leniently but could have served a two-year sentence in a state penitentiary, which would be a strong case for the admissibility of the evidence of her prior conviction. Consequently, A is the better option.

Unlike an employee hired under a contract, at-will employment allows for flexibility for both parties should the working arrangement not work out at any time.

Exceptions to employment-at-will working conditions vary by state but may include:

Contracts: A written employment contract or collective bargaining agreement signed by the employer and the employee or union may outline employment over a specific period or allow termination only for cause, such as poor employee performance, misconduct, or budgetary reasons. Employers who use employment contracts are responsible for upholding and enforcing the terms within the contract.

Public policy: Under the public policy exception to employment-at-will, an employee is wrongfully discharged when a termination is for reasons against the state's policy. For example, in most states, an employer cannot terminate an employee to avoid paying pension rights.

Good faith and fair dealing: An implied duty of good faith and fair dealing assumes that each party should interact fairly and honestly concerning the employment relationship. Examples of bad faith terminations include an employer firing an older employee to avoid paying retirement benefits or terminating a salesperson before they are paid commission after closing a sale.

Implied contracts: Implied contracts of employment can occur when an employee may expect long-term, lifetime, or permanent employment based on an employer's statement(s), an employer's practice, or language in the employee handbook. Employers can protect themselves by using precise language on written materials stating that their policies and procedures do not represent a binding agreement or contract. Employers can also clearly communicate that they can modify policies and procedures at any time.

Under the exceptions to at-will employment the example employer could be accused of sidelining the employee with a gift for life and then reneging on the agreement 6 mths later blaming difficult trading conditions. This wouldn’t be seen favourably under ‘good faith and fair dealing’, ‘public policy’ and ‘implied contracts’. Especially when the employee had given 20 years good service. 

It could be suggested that the employer’s behaviour was cynical when he terminated the employee with a temporary gift to avoid his pension responsibilities. The employee may even have a claim under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). ERISA prohibits the discharge of employees to prevent vesting of pension rights and governs how pension plans are to be administered by private employers. Consequently, option A is the more likely option to prevail.

The Empty Can Test, also known as the Jobe or Supraspinatus test, is used to assess for lesions of the rotator cuff, specifically the supraspinatus muscle and supraspinatus tendon.

With the supraspinatus isolation test/empty can test or Jobe test, the supraspinatus muscle can be isolated by having the patient rotate the upper extremity so that the thumbs are pointing to the floor and resistance is applied with the arms in 30° of forward flexion and 90° of abduction. This simulates the emptying of a can. Testing the arm with the thumb in 'thumbs up' (full can position) is best for maximal contraction of the supraspinatus muscle.

The resistance provided by the examiner enables them to assess for weakness or pain. Either response would represent a positive test, which would indicate a tear of the supraspinatus muscle or tendon, or a neuropathy of the suprascapular nerve.

While the Empty Can Test is a useful diagnostic tool it has limitations for isolated supraspinatus pathology, as many shoulder muscles are simultaneously stimulated.

How do you test for infraspinatus?

The patient is asked to externally rotate both forearms against the examiner's resistance. The test is positive when there is weakness or pain in external rotation. Infraspinatus tears are usually painless so external rotation weakness strongly suggests infraspinatus tear.

When comparing the individual tests for the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles the description in the example is much more likely to involve the supraspinatus muscle, hence B is the better answer.",B,,,,,,,,

To support a contract implied in fact, facts and circumstances surrounding the actions must show a mutual intent to contract, based on the behaviour of the respective parties. For example, if a customer enters a hair salon, sits in a chair, and asks for a haircut, which the hairdresser then provides, then by asking for the haircut, the customer has implicitly agreed to pay.

In the supplied example, the client leaves a written note expressly asking the lawyer: ‘Could you please verify if this agreement of purchase for my yacht is in line with local legislation?’
Consequently, the lawyer understands an implied-in-fact contract is being formed, as both parties' promises are inferred from their intentional conduct and he knows or at least has reason to know the other party will interpret the conduct as assent or an agreement.

To establish the existence of an implied in fact contract, it is necessary to show:

An unambiguous offer - the client’s question

Unambiguous acceptance – the lawyer provided a written answer to the question

Mutual intent to be bound – their mutual behaviour implies their intent to be bound

Consideration – as client and lawyer they have already shown consideration in drawing up the will. This second contract involves the lawyer’s consideration in providing his knowledge and the client’s consideration in paying for it. The payment terms are implied as the client knows the lawyer will expect to be paid for his work.

Although the client never agreed to engage the attorney directly she implied it by her question for the lawyer to verify the agreement.

That the boat sale never took place is irrelevant. The contract between them only concerned the lawyer verifying the terms of the agreement, not the sale of the boat.

With regards to the current case, the exception that applies is Rule 804 (b)(2) Statement Under the Belief of Imminent Death. According to this rule, to accept the hearsay evidence, the statement has to satisfy two criterea (1) the person making the statement, i.e., the dead victim should declare that the death is imminent (2) the circumstance or cause of the imminent death. The current case satisfies the criterea one, however, will it satisfy the second criterea is debatable according to me. Although, the doctor affidavit only includes the statement from the victim that his death is imminent, this affidavit is presented to court as a supporting evidence to the pedistrain's statement made to the nurse where he describes the circumstance of death i.e., the accident resulting in injuries.

Anything said after the police officer reads this right is used an evidence in court. The accused can wavier the right (i.e., give away this right) by explicity answering the questions or implicitly, by keeping silent while questioning. To consider that the accused has enforced his Miranda right, he has to invoke this by saying that he understands and wishes to be silent otherwise the police officer can consider that the accused has implicitly waviered his right. In the current situation, accused B did not invoke his Miranda right and therefore has waviered the right implicitly by being silent.

Now the question remains if this photo evidence of a person committing a crime violates the confrontational clause or not. The sixth amendment's confrontation clause in the US law suggests that a defendant has the right to confront the witness and the accuser in the court and cross-examine them about their allegations of the defendant's crime. In the current scenario, the witness is a survelliance camera, which cannot be cross-examined, therefore, can infringe the defendant's confrontation right. However, if an expert personnel from survelliance camera company or other experts can testify in the court as to how the camera obtains the images and the validity of the image taken, then the image from the survelliance camera can be used as an evidence against the defendant. A case study publication demonstrated that Portland Police Bureau proscecuted an accused using an infrared imagery as forensic evidence along with opininon from an expert.

In the current situation, I believe the officer's statement against the defendant can confuse the jury since the evidence only creates an unfair bias against the defentant in juries minds and does not prove that the defendant was causing accident to the claimant. From my experience answering previous questions in this project, I vaguely recalled that the officer's statement does not fall under any hearsay exceptions and option A could be also be right.

Rule 404 of US law states that character evidence is not a proof to show that a person in the given case acted according to the character evidence. However, character evidence of witness is permitable and further detailed in rule 607, 608, 609. Under rule 608 (b), court may, under cross-examination allow an extrinsic character evidence of unthruthfulness,  if the evidence is probabtive of untruthfulness of the witness or of another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about. The latter essentially translates to option B, where the character evidence of the claimant's witness is admissible in court if the respondent in cross-examination can bring another witness who can testify the character of claimant's witness. So option B is 100% likely right.",B,,,,,,,,

In the current case presence of fluid in the peritoneum is termed hemoperitonem and can be caused by bladder rupture or urthera rupture during the accident since spleen and liver are not damaged. The chances of urethra rupture is only 1% and the chances of bladder rupture are rather higher. In both the situation, the rupture is usually caused by an external object or a broken pelvis or spontaneous rupture of the bladder dome. Since the pelvis is not broken in the case, and no signs of external object mentioned, the bladder should have undergone spontaneous rupture. During urine filling, the bladder dome expands and stretches,any suden acceleration or deceleration force can spontaneously rupture the dome and the fluid can fill the peritoneum space. So in the present situation it is 100% likely that the bladder dome has ruptured.",B,,,,,,,,

Za'a in lojban means some kind of relationship observed by the observer, which is evidential or an opinion formed after seeing the event. On the other hand, ga'a in lojban means as seen by the observer, there is no opinion involved. In the current translation, 'As you saw, the snake bit me', the speaker is indicating that the observer witnessed the snake biting. To me it, it sounds like the observer noticed the event or in other words it is evident from the event observer witnessed that the snake bit the speaker. So, I think za'a is a better translation than ga'a.

A chest radiograph of this condition can find pulmonary interstitial edema. None of the medical blogs and journals I researched did not indicate Double bubble sign in RDS.

So, I concluded that the ear displacement is not due to current issue but could contribute to the symptoms. The child after treatment with amoxicillin for acute otitis media i.e., the middle ear infection, showed relapse of the symptom possibly due to a resistant bacterial infection. I next tried to find if ear microta causes relapsed ear infection. Although, I could not conlcude anything conclusive, a review paper from a peer reviewed journal indicated that  these situations need further examination otolaryngologist. None of the options A or option B seemed like the right answer to me at this point. I next read again the above review article about the treatment for persistent relapsed ear infections, the answer was to treat with a higher dose of amoxicillin or a different antibiotics. Again, none of the options fit the guideline to treat persistent infection. Guidelines for first time middle ear infection with mild symptoms for 2 to 12 year old is to observe and treat only if worsened. This is to avoid antibiotic resistance. So I went with the same arguement that probably option B, observing the child for next 14 days would be 75% likely better choice than option A. I conclude that none of these options are truely correct, the patient needs to be treated with different class of antibiotics or higher dose of amoxicillin.",A,,,,,,,,
