Your leg arteries carry oxygen and nutrient-rich blood from your heart to your arms and legs. Other names for this are peripheral vascular disease or peripheral arterial disease. I also learned about the symptoms, diagnosis and treatment and that gave me confidence that the correct method of treatment was A. Treating PAD, for some people with more severe PAD, leg pain may still cause problems in daily life, even after a few months of exercise and medications. In more severe cases, people need to improve their blood flow to relieve pain at rest or to heal a wound.

More advanced PAD that’s causing severe pain and limited mobility may require endovascular (minimally invasive) or surgical treatment. Some heart disease treatments also treat peripheral artery disease, including:

Angioplasty.
Stents.
Peripheral artery bypass surgery.
Atherectomy.

From my research, Lower extremity Angioplasty is a test that uses X-rays and contrast dye to see the arteries that carry blood to the legs. It’s used to look for narrowed or blocked areas in leg arteries that can cause leg pain when walking. This aligns perfectly with the AI's answer and this was why I choose the final probability",A,

I found that although they are factors which can contribute, they are in part consequences of a persons socio-economic status. Someone who is poorer than the average person who cannot afford medical care may have not sought medical attention previously for similar symptoms. This could lead to untreated illness and contribute to SBO and the situation in the case study. 

I looked at Option B as it seemed from the outset the more obvious choice (decompression for a compressed abdomen). The A.I seemingly took the same position which gave me a 75% likelihood in my opinion that Option B was correct. 

The AI stated that Option A is rarely used in treating SBO. My research supported this position. With researching confirming that the condition was SBO and that the most used and most effective treatment was Option B this gave a viewpoint of a 87% likelihood that Option B was correct.

For Option A I just couldn't see a scenario in which suspect b's silence could be used against himself. The facts didn't match the criteria for his silence to be admissible in court. So I gave Option A a low 14%.

The Supreme Court had ruled of silence being used in a court of law but it was not applicable to this case. ",B,I looked at all the suggestions but found 1 and 3 the most useful.

Varicoceles are described by a ""pack of worms"" surface, are delicate, compressible, and commonly easy. They frequently happen on the left side, yet can sporadically be tracked down on the right side too. Considering that varicoceles are for the most part harmless and asymptomatic except if they cause inconvenience or influence richness, the underlying administration approach is moderate. Therefore, the best course of action for managing this circumstance would be (Choice A) Wait and watch. This approach includes checking the varicocele for any progressions in size, side effects, or impacts on fruitfulness. In situations where the varicocele is causing significant discomfort, affecting fertility, or for cosmetic reasons, surgery (varicocelectomy) may be considered. (Choice B) Arranging an abdominal CT scan, isn't shown as the underlying step since varicoceles can commonly be analyzed clinically through history and actual physical assessment. Unless there are atypical features or concerns about other underlying conditions, imaging studies such as CT scans are not typically required for the diagnosis of varicoceles due to effects of radiation.

The salesman's bonus qualification is unequivocally attached to being a functioning representative at the time the invoice is given to the client. Commissions are only due if the salesman is still employed when the invoice is sent, as stated in the employment agreement. The chronology of events is as follows. The salesman got the order and got the supercomputer installed by March 1, 2011. The manufacturer fired the salesman on March 15, 2011, referring to execution issues connected with earlier years' objectives. On March 31, 2011, following the termination of the salesman, the manufacturer billed the client for the supercomputer. Regarding commission entitlement as a legal principle states that commissions are typically regarded as earned when they become due in accordance with the terms of the agreement in many jurisdictions, including US law. Here, the arrangement determines that the commission is procured when the invoice is given. According to the terms of his employment contract, the salesman would not be eligible for the commission because he was fired before the invoice was issued (on March 31). While the salesman focused on supporting the activity of the hardware post-establishment, this responsibility doesn't abrogate the reasonable authoritative condition for commission qualification attached to work status at the hour of invoicing. Therefore, the salesman's entitlement to the commission is contingent on his employment status at the time of invoicing, even though he was diligent in securing the sale and fulfilling the client's post-installation obligations. He probably wouldn't be entitled to the commission under the terms of his employment agreement because he was fired before the invoice was issued. As a result, upon termination, the manufacturer would probably prevail in rejecting his commission demand.",B,Yes.What are the specific laws in the US regarding sales commissions and termination of employment?

It gives nitty gritty data about strong organ injuries (liver, spleen), hollow viscus wounds, and presence of intra-abdominal bleeding.",A,Yes. What is the sensitivity and specificity of an abdominal CT scan in detecting intra-abdominal bleeding? I determined that an abdominal CT scan is the most appropriate step in diagnosis of suspected intra-abdominal bleeding or injuries.

The declarant in this scenario unfortunately succumbed to their burns, so we know the statement fits the criteria of one, being unavailable, and two, making a statement that was contrary to the declarant’s proprietary or pecuniary interest, as well as clearly indicating trustworthiness, where the statement was offered in a criminal case as one that tends to expose the declarant to criminal liability. I felt confident in my choice, but I also wanted to understand the concept of  a statement made by a co-conspirator. Although there wasn't a tonne of time to research, I believe that statements made by a co-conspirator would have to be given by that co-conspirator as testimony in court (correct me if I'm wrong, but this is what I believe was apparent), which obviously, in this scenario couldn't be the case due to the co-conspirator passing away.

When first reading the question and possible answers, I was unsure of the relevance of answer A, but then through my research it kind of confirmed this. 

First, I wanted to know the foundations of the admissibility of camera and surveillance footage relevance in a court case in the US. It confirmed that it is, if relevance and authenticity can be demonstrated, which I believe in this scenario they can. There are a handful foundations that the footage could be found inadmissible, which the most common are: 

(1) Undue Prejudice: An attorney can argue that the photo or video evidence is not a reasonable representation of its subject and may result in undue prejudice. 

(2) Hearsay: If there is no witness present who can be cross-examined, an attorney can argue that the substance of the photo or video evidence is hearsay. 

(3) The Best Evidence Rule: If the photo or video is secondary evidence (a copy or facsimile), an attorney can argue that the original copy is superior evidence. 

(4) Lack of Foundation: When visibility, the time of day, the weather or some other factor is at issue in the litigation, an attorney can question a substantial similarity between the occurrence in question and the photo or video evidence.

I thought at this point there was no chance that the footage could be inadmissible. So, I then had a look at the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which again, felt irrelevant. This rule states that ""in all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him,"" which sure, but that isn't in question here.

So, this is how I came to the conclusion that B was 100% the correct answer.",B,

However, my first step was to go back to the Rules that pertain to evidence and hearsay, and figure out whether what the pedestrian stated was even admissible in the first place.

It became clear that under the Federal Rules of Evidence, a dying declaration is admissible if the proponent of the statement can establish all of the following:

* The declarant's statement is being offered in a criminal prosecution for homicide, or in a civil action. Some states also permit the admission of dying declarations in other types of cases.
* The declarant is unavailable – this can be established (in this case, they've died)
* The declarant's statement was made while under the genuine belief that their death was imminent. Although, the declarant does not have to actually die.
* The declarant's statement relates to the cause or circumstances of what they believed to be their impending death.

So in consideration of the above, the pedestrian's statement does seem admissible as long as we can establish that they genuinely believed that they were going to die. This is where the affidavit became more significant, as I knew now that I needed to establish whether the affidavit of the trainee doctor is also admissible as evidence to confirm that the pedestrian had this belief, which I found the following for:

""While an affidavit is admissible evidence, many courts may deem it hearsay or unreliable and require that you testify to the affidavit to avoid this distinction,"" and ""... It is worth noting that affidavits and witnesses provide the court with valuable information regarding what has happened and eliminates time consuming procedures. It is not about what the individual feels or thinks about what happened. This means that if your affidavit contains speculation or arguments, the court may refuse to consider it.""

In saying this, because the affidavit contains information that the trainee doctor directly witnessed (not speculation), and is directly relevant to establishing the dying declaration exception, I believe it should be considered by the court - answer A. I'm not super confident on this one, which is why I have placed a not-so-confident probability.",A,

Firstly, I searched ""subclavian steal syndrome symptoms"" to understand whether the AI's response was accurate, which is did appear to be, so I followed the trail of information from there.

The symptoms of this condition (if present) indicate that patients may present with arm pain, fatigue, numbness, or paresthesias. It can also present as a variety of neurological symptoms such as dizziness, blurring of vision, syncope, vertigo, disequilibrium, ataxia, tinnitus, or hearing loss. This fit well with the description of the scenario, so then I went to check the treatment and/or management for this condition.

Treatment for this condition may consist of an angioplasty. I wasn't sure what this was, so I searched ""is an angioplasty the same as a stent"", which resulted in the answer of ""most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure."" So, B was looking very promising.

Moving on, I wanted to know whether brachial and radial pulses can correlate with certain blood pressure results, which they apparently can. So, I wanted to continue evaluating A's answer, and found that ""blood pressure will be higher in the arm that gets blood from a healthy subclavian artery.""

If this fell through, then the contract falls through, and the purchaser may have a claim, but this wasn't the case - the lessor agreed to transfer the lease.

So this basically left me with the answer of A, which I did research further and mainly focused on the binding and enforceability of the letters in regards to real estate. Particularly because we don't know whether the parties actually signed anything. Many resources reiterated this same notion that: ‌‌‌An agreement can be made over the phone, via email, or letter, but an ironclad contract must be identical in everyone’s office before it is signed.

Another aspect of this is that jurisdictions differ on their use of ""agreement"" in denoting a legally enforceable contract. For example, the Supreme Court of Washington has stated that a contract is a promise or set of promises which is protected under the law, whereas an agreement is a manifestation of mutual assent which does not necessarily carry legal implications.

She also specifically stated ""I would have preferred to discuss this matter in person, however, I am currently en route to a different location. I should be able to return by the following week"", which indicates that she doesn't need to meet the lawyer in person.

The AI bot indicates that this is a contract implied-in-fact, which I researched first. Both express contracts and implied contracts are legally enforceable promises of mutual assent to be bound. The lawyer proceeding with research and writing the letter indicates his agreement to the work, which demonstrates the mutual assent aspect. So, I wanted to move on from this and have a look at the ""led to a disadvantage to him"" aspect of answer B.

I actually couldn't find much about this, which made me feel as though A is definitely the correct answer. When researching I came across the case of Bailey v West, which further reiterated that an implied obligation that is acted upon, is grounds for a valid implied-in-fact contract.

When researching the Venous Duplex Ultrasound, it appeared to directly correlate with thrombosis symptoms and related far more heavily to the symptoms described, while a CT angiogram was far more relevant in regards to a presumed blood clot.

From my understanding of the question, I believe the proper approach was to figure out what diagnosis tool was better when considering lower extremity thrombosis. I continued to search terms relating to these two scans, and comparing these scans, and actually came across a resource that states the VDS is the standard test for diagnosing DVT. I then found a resource that stated ""you may need a CT scan if the D-dimer shows that you may have a blood clot,"" and while a D-dimer test is not the same as VDS, it is also another initial test that is conducted for DVT. So, this indicated to me that CT scans are done primarily for the purpose of identifying a blood clot, rather than diagnosing thrombosis.

First, I simply wanted to know more about ""commissions after quitting"", as I felt as though this would be a heavily discussed topic online. I've never worked a commission-based job, so I truly didn't know much about the legalities behind it. I found on forums that people mostly came to the conclusion of ""oh well, bad luck"" if they missed their last commission due to a lack of provisions in their contract, or their contract had specific terms, while other resources indicated that commissions are considered wages in some states, the employees have a right to their wage (naturally).

Overall, I kept researching different variations of ""commission after termination"", ""common law notice period commission"", ""what happens to my commission when I quit"", and ""commission when terminated"" to get an idea. Again, it's clear that commissions are often considered wages, but it can also be dependent on contract terms.

Answer A didn't necessarily feel to relevant, apart from the notion that an employee is due their wages for the services provided, which again, a commission is a wage more often than not. However, the language of ""as he had committed to the client to aid in the operation of the equipment,"" is not exactly relevant.

The AI distinguishes ""nelmau"" as having a ""more than"" meaning, which honestly, I just couldn't find any documentation on and I didn't believe. Many translations I found used the word ""nelci"" when saying ""X likes Y"", but something I found in particular was the sentence structure, which was very similar to English.

In answer A, we have the name ""tea"" before the subject of ""Jane"", while in answer B, we had the opposite. It didn't make much sense that the answer would be ""Mark likes Jane, Tea,"" over the opposing response of A's ""Mark likes tea, Jane,"" so I leaned more towards answer A.

Overall, I truly didn't find much in terms of translations, again I just kept trying to find different information relating to ""zmanei,"" ""nelmau,"" ""likes,"" ""more than,"" and didn't achieve a whole lot with this approach due to the limited resources. Many resources didn't even include these terms, which didn't help. So while I've flicked the probability in favour of A, I'm honestly not super confident with this response, except for the fact that it is structured better than B and more in line with Lojban sentence examples I found (in my opinion).",B,

The main thing that made me think it was definitely a bladder dome injury is the use of a catheter. In urethra trauma, not being able to pass a tube into the urethra is the first sign of urethral injury, and a Foley catheter goes directly into the urethra, which they were able to do in this scenario.

Bladder dome trauma is considered relatively common in car accidents, especially when the person has a full bladder. One can assume that the patient being drunk, they likely had a pretty full bladder from the alcohol. No blood being present in the urethral meatus also indicates that the injury comes from somewhere more internally, like the bladder dome.

An example could be the law in New Jersey that requires complete fair and honest disclosure if the seller even slightly believes that the disclosure would make a difference in the customer's purchasing decision. If the seller omits a material fact from a transaction they are responsible. If they mislead the customer they are responsible. If the seller of the vehicle misrepresents the history of vehicle or misrepresents the condition of the vehicle they are liable under most circumstances.

On the other hand, unconscionability can arise when the terms of a contract so unreasonably favour the stronger party to the point of being oppressive that the court feels the need to intervene - this was not the case. The buyer was not oppressed, just misled.

In a unilateral contract, the offeror may revoke the offer before the offeree's performance begins.

Varicocele seemed to mostly fit the description with its ""bag of worms"" texture, but there were a couple of inconsistencies:

- Varicocele should reduce in size or disappear when lying down.
- Normally appear on the left side. Right-side varicocele are rare (which this patient presented with a right-side growth).

For testicular cancer, the characteristics are:

- Generally a small, hard lump.
- Presents itself alongside other pain symptoms, like soreness or tenderness of the testicles.

In terms of treatments, it only appears that CT scans generally happen when cancer has already been diagnosed, and instead, ultrasounds are one of the first steps in dealing with an unknown testicular growth. In the case of this patient, although he doesn't fit the full picture for varicocele, he's asymptomatic (there could be an underlying cause though), and from my understanding, it would be a wait and observe situation.",B,

This scenario, from my understanding, constitutes promissory estoppel as the father had clear intentions of supporting his son with some generalised ""requirements."" The definition of promissory estoppel is: Promissory estoppel is a contract law doctrine that allows a plaintiff to recover damages, despite no actual contract, when the defendant made a promise that the plaintiff detrimentally relied upon, and the plaintiff’s reliance on that promise was reasonable..

I looked at the meaning of detrimental reliance, which is defined as a situation where one party suffers harm or incurs a loss as a result of relying on the promises or representations made by another party. The son has incurred a loss in regards to the financial support from his father, and unfortunately, the father's death caused a breach of their contract.

The reason for this is because the Uniform Commercial Code, which the AI referenced, actually lays out the requirements very clearly.

First, 2-308 of the Code ""Absence of Specified Place for Delivery,"" states that unless otherwise agreed:

(a) the place for delivery of goods is the seller's place of business or if he has none his residence; but
(b) in a contract for sale of identified goods which to the knowledge of the parties at the time of contracting are in some other place, that place is the place for their delivery; and
(c) documents of title may be delivered through customary banking channels.

From the context, I think it's reasonable to believe that the plumbing parts are at the Supplier's business address, so this would become the default address for delivery under s308.

Next is understanding the terms of payment, which 2-511 of the Code, ""Tender of Payment by Buyer; Payment by Check"" specifies the following:

(1) Unless otherwise agreed tender of payment is a condition to the seller's duty to tender and complete any delivery.

Meaning that the seller requires payment upon completion of the delivery, rather than a ""reasonable timeframe afterwards"" as the AI has stated. There are a couple of other sections of the Code that reference price at the time for delivery (such as 2-305).

Finally, I found another resource that supports the answer B - ""If the time for payment is not specified, then the goods must be paid for at the time and place the buyer receives the goods.""

The defendant pleaded guilty in this scenario, and the conviction is not being used as a method to demonstrate the defendant's colourful background, but rather, to showcase evidence that directly relates to the incident that occurred.

Firstly, under Rule 607 of the Federal Rule of Evidence, any party, including the party that called the witness, may attack the witness’s credibility. 

However, Rule 608 proceeds to state that:

Extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. But the court may, on cross-examination, allow them to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of:

(1) the witness; or
(2) another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about.

While this makes me believe that B is likely the correct answer, one of the more recent amendments states that Rule 608 was amended to clarify that the absolute prohibition on extrinsic evidence applies only when the sole reason for proffering that evidence is to attack or support the witness’ character for truthfulness.

So in all honesty, I felt a little bit 50/50 on this question but ultimately felt like B may be the correct answer due to the specific wording of ""Admitted, but only if it's obtained from the expert witness during cross examination.""",B,

“Roger, X!”, “I understand”; acknowledges the successful receipt of a communication from the listener, while the negative form indicates failure to receive correctly, and is usually followed by ""ke'o"". For example, “What did you say, X?”; a request for repetition or clarification due to unsuccessful receipt or understanding (this is a ke'o scenario).

So, while babies who have a hip pop or hip click can be diagnosed with hip dysplasia, not all babies with a hip pop have a problem with their hips.

While some infants that have a hip click will be diagnosed with hip dysplasia, there are babies with hip clicks that have normal hips.""

An ultrasound is the appropriate approach in diagnosing hip dysplasia in babies as their hips are apparently mostly cartilage. However, I feel that with the low-risk scenario and the baby being 3 weeks old, an ultrasound wouldn't be the doctor's first answer to a hip pop. To me, I'd imagine a doctor reassuring the mother ""while the popping could be a sign of dysplasia, let's keep an eye on it for the next appointment"".

However, I found myself focusing more so on the consideration aspect of the contract, over the release in writing.

While it's ideal that a modification to a contract should be in writing, I found two cases that deal with the variation of a contract verbally, when the written contract contains a clause requiring any variations to be in writing:

Son-Shine Grading, Inc. v. ADC Const. Co., 68 N.C. App. 417, 315 S.E.2d 346 (1984) which found that a  verbal agreement between superintendents for contractor and subcontractor sufficient to amend subcontract despite clause prohibiting verbal amendments);

In light of the above and my findings on the pre-existing duty doctrine, I believe that the following applies to this scenario: if a party to a contract does what they are already obligated to do in exchange for a modification of the contract, the modification will be voidable.

From my understanding, the word ""ku"" is also used primarily at the end of a sentence as a 'terminator', which it wasn't in the example provided in B...

This was another difficult one to research, particularly because the structure of the sentences were vastly different. I wanted to break down the structure of the two sentences mostly, and used the 'La Sutysisku' database because it helps me visualise how the sentences can go together.

Ultimately, both felt kind of correct, but I did believe something may have applied from my previous question relating to Lojban. This was that the words ""ku"" and ""cu"" could often be omitted from a sentence, and there's not many times when they are deemed necessary in a sentence. While I'm not sure what the hard rule is for this, it made me lean a little bit towards B.

In addition to this, from the examples that I found when it came to the use of ""co'a"" as an initiative, it always appeared quite close or next to the verb that it was referring to. So ""[initiative] singing"" as ""co'a cmoni"" ... A did not reflect this finding, and while I'm not sure if it's 100% correct, I decided to lean towards B with a 45/55 probability because it felt a little bit more accurate than A.",B,

It was apparent that acute otitis media with hearing loss is much more concerning than the average infection, but the actual symptoms of the child kind of had me on the fence about whether A or B was appropriate.

Firstly, I googled all of the different averages for heart rate, blood pressure, etc, and then found myself on ""Persistent acute otitis media - treatment failure"", which led me to otitis media with effusion (aka the ear infection with hearing loss). Here, a lot of other symptoms that the child didn't present with were listed, but the hearing loss is apparently still quite concerning. CT scans are referred to in a lot of searches. 

However, I did also find a flowchart for the treatment of acute otitis media, which actually references doing multiple courses of antibiotics, even where symptoms persist. One part of this flowchart stated that if the symptoms resolved, but then become recurrent, then ""watchful waiting and antibiotics"" are the next step. If this fails, then imaging can be the next step. So I actually do kind of think that B may be the answer... But A also feels appropriate, so I went ever so slightly with A.",A,

The statement made by the co-conspirator in this situation is admissible in and of itself, as the man would then have the right to confrontation whilst in court, so the statement should not be denied... But the question is regarding his actual silence. 

There seems to be quite a bit of conflicting case law on the subject, but given that the Miranda Rights were not finished and the overarching stress of the situation, i.e. the other person bursting out with a confession, I do not think silence would be deemed admissible as evidence in proving his guilt due to a variety of factors, for example, shock.",B,

It appeared over and over in my research that nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression is ideal for a distended and tympanitic bowel, as it relieves the patient of the distention pain and helps small bowel obstructions resolve over the course of a few days. If it's not resolved, that is when other methods are looked into.

While this is a major surgery, it seemed quite apparent that the patient was pretty far down the line with this issue, being that his brachial index on the right is 0.3 and having the persistent ulcer and not great medical history.

I found that antibiotics are often administered to diabetic patient for post-operative purposes, especially with amputations. As this patient does not have any of the signs of an infected ulcer, I don't think antibiotics would be the right course.

However, in order to proceed with the revascularization, the patient will need a CT angiogram first, and afterwards to assess how the operation went.

Another reason for this being serious is that the treatment was done as per standard using amoxicillin but still the fever has returned which shows that they might have prolonged the disease before starting the treatment and it spread in the meantime. Lastly CT scan is the preferred method for diagnosis and so the next step should be a CT Scan.,A,"1. What are the typical symptoms of mastoiditis in children?

The PBGC is a government chartered entity that protects pension benefits even if your company goes bankrupt or there are no assets left in the pension https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pension_Benefit_Guaranty_Corporation.

The fine line here the order was signed by the client before the termination and the company previously acknowledged the efforts that the sales person put in. Another factor here is that the employee was dismissed rather than voluntary resignation .

The first website I hit after my Google search was the Cornell/LII website. I know this is a reputable source of information on US law. The wording on the website seemed to immediately confirm both aspects of what the AI was saying: that in a unilateral contract, the offer can only be accepted by performance. This rules out option A. It then goes on to state that the offer may be revoked BEFORE the performance begins – as the AI explained, the customer had already started their performance by waiting in the queue. The language on this website was very easy to understand (not 'legalese') so I felt very confident that I had understood correctly.

At this point, I just wanted to back up both assertions from other reputable sources, which I did. 

I did note that if the scenario had taken place at some point in the past, before the law changed on when a unilateral contract offer can be revoked, then B would have been incorrect.

My first goal was to confirm the definitions that the AI assigned to 'tavla' and 'casnu' were correct. I was able to confirm this quite quickly via some reputable Lojban online resources.

Rather than take the AI's word for it that 'casnu' would be more correct, my next step was to confirm whether Lojban has room for nuance. I don't think I had even managed to search for that yet before stumbling upon an assertion by a speaker in r/Lojban that the language leaves no room for ambiguity. I then confirmed this assertion via another trustworthy resource. 

Given that a goal of this constructed language is to eliminate ambiguity, it therefore makes sense that if the language contains different words for ""talk"" and ""discuss"", they would not be used interchangeably. If this was indeed a discussion that the sentence referred to, then the word for 'discuss' would certainly be used.

English is of course a more nuanced language, but considering the sentiment that what they had ""talked about"" was very important to them, this suggests a discussion, as opposed to a less purposeful ""talk"" (i.e. 'small talk'), which I gather 'tavla' would imply.

Since I had plenty of time remaining, I did some other research to confirm the definitions were correct. Once I had done this, I was certain that short of asking an actual Lojban speaker about this directly, I had exhausted all channels of research, so I finished early.

I think it has gotten mixed up between the two statements (by security guard and director), as I did at first when I read through the question and its reasoning.

The retail store is on trial here (and so is the party being represented); when the security guard made his statement during his own criminal proceedings, he was no longer an employee of the store. The AI says that the statement is admissible because he was an employee at the time he was given the instructions by the director. But the exception states that he had to be been an employee at the time he made his OWN statement, not when the director made his 'statement' to the employee.

At first, I did some research on exceptions to the hearsay rule, and to determine what was meant by 'party's agent'. I was confused throughout the first chunk of research as I was trying to prove the AI correct, and it didn't make sense.

Finally, it clicked that the AI had the statements mixed up, and I was able to confirm that while yes, what it said about Rule 801(d)(D) is correct, it would not apply in this case because the security guard was not an employee at the time of making the (transcripted) testimony in question.

My research confirmed the rules around the admissibility of hearsay, but it was mostly by re-reading, and carefully thinking through the question and AI response, that I arrived at my answer. The initial research to define certain terminology helped me to understand and consider this more clearly.

I settled on 30/70 because while my understanding of the matter has me convinced, I have no legal background, and I didn't understand some of the terminology before my 20 mins of research.

In the course of this research, I came across the concept of Promissory Estoppel. This would certainly validate the second point in the AI's response – the part that I had had my doubts about. 

I assumed the first point in the AI's response was correct, that the formal, signed decree would constitute a contract. And the 'action' on the part of the executive to fulfil his part of the contract would be the act of retirement, which he did.

But I noted that he was filing the lawsuit under 'breach of contract'. Without having any knowledge of law, I spent most of the rest of my research time aiming to clarify whether Promissory Estoppel can be applied in a breach of contract lawsuit, or whether this would be a separate lawsuit/argument. After all, some of the (reliable) resources suggested that Promissory Estoppel applies when a contract is not present, i.e. it was 'just' a promise.

I note that I then got so caught up in this that I didn't do any research on whether financial difficulties would absolve the company from its contractual obligations. So I'm taking the AI on its word for this point!

My final 75:25 probability is based on the fact that Promissory Estoppel did appear in multiple resources as part of a larger ""contract law"" or ""breach of contract"" section. And some text suggested that it would apply as an exception, although I confess I didn't 100% understand the explanations.

So, while I didn't conclusively satisfy myself that Promissory Estoppel can be applied alongside the other argument points given by the AI in a breach of contract lawsuit, even if a contract was present, I am going on the assumption that this is the case.

At first, I decided to check out what some reliable sources said about undue influence. The definition seemed to fit the AI's description, but there was emphasis on how this needed to be proved, and how that could be difficult. Although we know from the description that undue influence DID happen, I needed to be sure that the son could prove it. 

My next searches showed that to prove undue influence, one must demonstrate that the accused received a substantial benefit (they did), and that they had a confidential relationship with the victim (they did). According to https://www.upchurchlaw.com/blog/2022/may/how-to-prove-undue-influence/, the 'signs' of undue influence were also met (surprisingly large amount left to individual with no explanation, the victim was vulnerable, and they were dependent on the accused, albeit for company not for care).

At that point I felt more convinced of the 'undue influence' argument, but now needed to research 'insufficient consideration'.

The resources I found were murky on the subject; they stated that normally, courts would not care about assessing fair monetary value of the exchange if the contract had been agreed by both parties. 

One website used the alternative term ""inadequate consideration"", so I researched this, on the assumption it was the same thing. The website I consulted suggested that the value consideration would need to be ""grossly inadequate to shock the conscience”, i.e. extreme, in order to void the contract. I continued to research insufficient consideration plus the keyword ""extreme"" until my time was up.

At the end of my research, I felt I could not conclusively determine which answer was correct, as it would probably come down to whether undue influence could be proved, vs. whether paying $100k for a $250k house is considered extremely unfair.

As I know from the description that undue influence did happen, and that the conditions for proving it appear to be met (as far as my research showed), I felt this was the more likely answer. If the house had been sold for a ridiculous amount such as $1 or even $10k, I'd consider this to be extreme, but in a sale between family members, I didn't think $100k was much of a stretch.

They seemed to confirm the AI's definitions, but I still wasn't sure which one would apply.

I then researched Hajj, as while I had some idea of what the event consisted of, I wanted to confirm the specifics. I found that Hajj refers to a pilgrimage that takes place WITHIN Mecca (moving through Mecca).

Still, I felt that going by the English use of ""in"", either translation could apply.

I then searched various Lojban resources for examples of both words in use. One translated phrase that I found on r/lojban helped:

""xu ro plise pe ne'i le lanka cu xunre — go'i na'i. Are all the apples in the basket red ?""

Ne'i was used here, and we could easily replace ""basket"" with ""Mecca"" here. So I thought perhaps ne'i is the correct term to use when referring to a place.

However, other translated phrases found via the Glosbe dictionary confused me further. (""These cameras are made in Japan. – loi vi kacma cu se zbasu bu'u lo pongu'e"" – one could also replace ""Japan"" with ""Mecca"" here.)

I then found a website that, although it didn't cover ""ne'i"", it defined ""bu'u"" as follows:

bu'u ma	– Where? – (literally) ""at what""

I felt this reinforced the idea I had already gleaned from the AI's explanation, that ""bu'u"" would translate more to ""at Mecca"" while ""ne'i"" would more correctly translate to ""in Mecca"".

As the original English phrase used ""in Mecca"" (and I ran out of time trying to find helpful examples, after realising I'd never understand Lojban grammar quickly), I decided that B was more likely correct. However, I hadn't conclusively proved this, and I feel my reasoning is a little flimsy, so I stuck with the 40/60 probability.",A,

As mentioned, I found the AI's definition of the two differing Lojban particles to be very different in meaning. If I could prove that the AI's definitions were correct, I'd be satisfied that it had given the correct answer.

My initial search on Lojban particles didn't bear any fruit (I was hoping for a simple explanation, maybe a list of common particles). However, by searching for the phrases directly, I was able to quickly find that the AI's definitions were backed up by reliable online Lojban dictionaries.

I double- and triple-checked their definitions, and when this was confirmed twice more, I was satisfied that the AI had given the correct answer.

I ended my research early, as I didn't think any further research was required to either prove or disprove the AI's response.

Firstly, I decided to research the medical terms that I did not understand. I checked out each term (and sometimes an accompanying image) on reputable medical websites (and on Wikipedia at one point, though I just clicked through to see the image).

I also considered the parts of the explanation that I did already understand. The patient's abdomen was distended. He had also been drinking alcohol. We all need to pee after a few beers! The AI stated that the bladder dome is susceptible to injury in high-energy trauma, especially when the bladder is full. Given all this, I think it's likely that the patient's bladder was full.

I also note that the patient was restrained (wearing a seat belt) while driving. Having experienced wearing a seat belt with a full bladder, I know that even in normal circumstances, the bottom part of the seatbelt can exert uncomfortable pressure over the bladder. In a high-speed collision, an injury here does seem likely. The fact that my research backed this up, and noted that the bladder dome is the weakest part of the bladder, strengthens the argument.

My research confirmed that the bladder dome does sit near the peritoneum (much nearer to it than the male urethra does). When I translated the medical language to learn that the CT scan showed that fluid was actively leaking from somewhere into the peritoneum, I agreed with the AI that it was more likely to have come via a breach in the bladder dome. (And there was no option for another intra-pelvic injury to have been the cause.)

I was feeling quite certain that the AI was right at this point, so I decided to research the opposite argument for the urethra. I found that a common symptom of urethral injury in males is blood at the meatus – which the patient did not have. I found that another cause of urethra injury in males is a high-riding prostate, but it was stated that the patient's prostate was normal.

I also found that gross hematuria – blood in the urine – can also happen with a bladder dome injury.

In summary, once I had 'translated' the medical language into something more understandable to me, and did some research on symptoms and causes of the two types of injury in question, I was completely confident that the AI was correct. At the point where I felt that no more research would help either way, I set my probability at 0/100 and stopped my research early.",B,

If this is true, and the hip popping could be a sign of a medical condition, it would not be appropriate just to brush off the mother with reassurances.

On the first website (NHS, so trustworthy), it mentioned risk factors for this condition. The baby is female, and being female is a risk factor, but the baby did not seem to meet the other risk factors, as the pregnancy was unremarkable (amniotic fluid not low), delivery was smooth (not breech) and they were not the firstborn (mother was G3P2 – I had to look that up).

The NHS website also suggested that a scan should take place at 4-6 weeks of age, but this baby is only 3 weeks old.

So I was not yet convinced.

I then decided to check what other credible websites said about when the baby should receive a scan. Some suggested that hip instability often corrects itself by 2-3 weeks of age, which seemed a likely reason for waiting on a scan. Later on, another website (NIH) suggested that a scan isn't reliable until the fourth week of life (day 22 and beyond). At first I thought this suggested the baby shouldn't be scanned, but then realised if it's 3 weeks old, that would put it at 21 days. (There also seemed to be disagreement online on when was the optimal time for a scan.)

I also thought about wait times for getting an ultrasound scan. It's not clear where this situation is taking place, and in any case it would be hard to predict. But assuming a wait time of a week or so, the baby would then be safely within the NHS' recommended 4-6 week range. The NHS website even mentioned that a baby's hip may stabilise on its own before the scan is due, but that it should still be checked out anyway.

So, I concluded that it's not too early to order a scan.

I did still wonder whether the scan would be considered 'overkill' considering the baby's relatively low risk factors. But the NHS Scotland clinical guidelines suggested that 75% of DDH cases are females, and so other risk factors are poor predictors. A radiology website confirmed there are no adverse effects of an infant receiving an ultrasound scan. So, probably not overkill.

In the meantime, I had also confirmed that a hip popping sound is a potential sign of DDH. It might also simply indicate a 'clicky hip', but it's recommended to get a scan if the medical examiner is not sure of the cause. This isn't mentioned in the original description, but I'd personally err on the side of caution if unsure.

At the end of my research period, I was very certain that the AI was correct – the next step is to order an ultrasound scan. Due to some slight uncertainty over low risk factors, potential for 'clicky hip' and scan timing vs the child's age, I set my probability at 10/90.

I went with ga'a first, since the AI suggested it was correct. It was tricky to find a clear definition regarding perspective; the first website I checked suggested it was indeed about witnessing/observing, but from whose perspective (reader or listener) it wasn't clear.

I then looked up za'a, and found that a couple of Lojban dictionary websites defined it as ""I observe."" I checked the definition of an 'evidential' in Lojban, as za'a was described as being an evidential. I found that evidential refers to the type of particle that it is, so that didn't affect my understanding of it.

I also then found on Lojban.org that ""A bridi marked by za'a is based on perception or direct observation by the speaker."" 

From previous research (on an earlier question) I know that Lojban is a logical language that aims to eliminate ambiguity. Therefore, I don't believe that a particle meant to indicate an action (seeing the snake) on the speaker's part would be used to indicate an action on the listener's part. 

So this seemed to eliminate (A) as a possibility.

I had plenty of time left, so I continued my research to get to the bottom of the definition of ga'a.

I checked the definition of zgana after finding that ga'a is a preposition from this word, but unfortunately it turned out that za'a is also a preposition from zgana, so this didn't help.

I then found a further ga'a definition on Lojban.org that seemed to place ga'a as more passive, referring to ""what is being observed"". However this seems to be when a noun is placed directly after it, which I don't believe is the case in the provided sentence.

Regardless, if ga'a refers to what is being observed ""as you can see"" and za'a refers more to the observer, ga'a would be more correct. I was also confident that I had eliminated za'a as a possibility. I ended my research early.

My final probability of 1/99 indicates that I am certain I eliminated A as a possible answer. However, I wasn't able to confirm the AI's exact definition of ga'a as ""used to indicate that the listener has directly observed something"". 

I think the AI is correct, but its exact reasoning may be a little off. Or, my research wasn't thorough enough (very possible – this was a tricky one, and I didn't have time to go into definitions of terms like 'bridi' etc).",B,

I previously worked closely with salespeople at a software company. From experience, I couldn't fathom why A would be correct – in the question it does not state that the salesperson continued to support the client after his termination, and it does state that another salesperson was assigned to the account. So, that salesperson would be doing the follow-up support. Even if no-one had been reassigned to the account as yet, a terminated employee would never be allowed to conduct follow-up support with a client. And in any case, the follow-up support is costing the manufacturer money, not the client. So there's no reason it should have any bearing on why the salesperson should get his commission.

Proving that A was incorrect, or that B was correct, was difficult, however.

Firstly, I looked up general reasons as to why an employment contract might become invalid, to get some ideas for further research. One website mentioned contracts might become invalid if they fail to adhere to business law in general. So, I checked US law in general on withholding sales commissions.

I found that in this case, state law can overrule employment contract terms regarding commission, but not federal law. In this case, I concluded that state law was not applicable, because the question didn't mention the state in which the company/salesperson was based, and in any case, the reasoning in (A) for the employee prevailing didn't involve state law.

I then turned to the reasoning in (A) and tried researching support clauses in contracts, follow up support, etc, but couldn't find anything relevant. Looking for further 'clues' in the question, I briefly checked whether any changes to the law regarding sales commissions had been enacted in 2010 or 2011, but nothing came up (I didn't spend much time on this though).

I then tried to look up federal regulations regarding compensation and commission, but didn't have much luck with that. 

Finally, I went back to my earlier search on withholding sales commission, and found a website that specifically discussed the withholding of commission after a termination. It reiterated that it would be state law that would overrule any terms in the employment contract. It also mentioned that an agreement is considered stronger in writing (as the contract was), and it even mentioned that some companies may stipulate that commission is only earned when the invoice is generated, which matches our situation exactly.

At the end of my research, I felt very strongly that (B) was the correct response. (A) just didn't seem to make any sense, and it seemed that if the client prevailed, it would be down to state law, not another reason. 

But, I couldn't prove it – not even close. Hence my final 25/75 probability.",B,

Was the contract voidable – or was there a contract in the first place? It seemed that, if the contract was voidable due to incapacity, the correct answer would be 'whichever comes first'.

I researched oral contracts initially, to see whether they are legally binding in the US. Yes, they generally are, but it's difficult to prove. So, (A) was still possibly correct.

I noted that the neighbour wanted to buy the car for business purposes. I ran a search on whether oral contracts can be applied when one party is a business, but no results seemed to jump out at me either way.

Then, I decided to check out the reasoning behind (B). Would incapacity void a contract?

According to LII, yes, a contract with someone deemed incompetent is voidable unless the contract involves a person who has legal guardianship of them. 

I then found that according to Investopedia, ""a contract may be void if it is found that one of the parties was incapable of fully understanding its implications."" But here, I learned there is a difference between ""void"" and ""voidable"". I read up on the differences, but ""voidable"" seemed to apply here as much as ""void"" did. The difference being, that despite the contract being unfair, if it's voidable, it can still go ahead if both parties are willing. In this case, it wouldn't change the outcome for the neighbour.

I briefly wondered (off-screen) whether by suing for breach of contract, that was acknowledgement of there being a contract. But then I realised it would only be by acknowledgement by the plaintiff, so that wasn't relevant.

I then looked up wither a voidable contract can be oral – yes, it can.

At this point, I came across the Statute of Frauds, but found that it doesn't apply to invalidate the oral contract in this case, as the proposed sale was for less than $500.

I finally thought it over again, and concluded that capacity seems to come 'first' in this 'chicken and egg' scenario. If the neighbour was incapacitated – which she was – there couldn't even be an ORAL contract to start with, let alone any contract. So there'd be no oral contract to invalidate (because it wasn't written down), making (B) the more likely answer.

My final probabilities of 25/75 reflect that both (A) and (B) still seem like valid reasons to invalidate the contract, as the AI also seems to imply. But (B) seems to apply before (A) could be considered – in my head at least. I didn't prove this.",B,

At first, I was unsure how to approach this question. I looked up both muscles, mostly to get a visual idea of where they are in the body. I actually tried moving my own arm according to the exercise described, to see if I could detect which muscle was active, but it was difficult to tell.

I then checked the definition of ""edematous shoulder"". It just means that the shoulder is swollen. The description mentioned the entire rotator cuff (of which both mentioned muscles are a part), so I didn't think it useful to proceed with further research on this point.

I then searched ""shoulder abduction thumbs downward"" – Bingo!

I found a reliable medical website that provided a guide to testing each of the four rotator cuff muscles individually.

The test for the supraspinatus appeared to be very close to what was described in the question. The infraspinatus test was very different. I was now feeling more confident that the AI was right.

I then looked up how to assess both muscles, to back this up. While doing this, I found that supra- inflammation is more common to overhead sports players (the patient is a basketball player), while intra- inflammation is more common to those who do repetitive motions (basketball isn't as known for this as, say, badminton).

I then found that another website backed up the method described earlier for the infra- pain test. And the NIH website described the supra- pain test exactly as it was in the question.

Then I looked up ""superior displacement of the ear"", which means the ear is protruding. Otitis was mentioned in the results here, but so was Mastoiditis, which the AI mentioned. Mastoiditis can indeed be a complication of Otitis, as the AI claimed.

According to the NIH web page I consulted, ""if the initial AOM [acute otitis media] was treated with antibiotics,  there may be an interval of improvement followed by an abrupt worsening of symptoms"" – this is just as described in the question. This website also mentioned that in Mastoiditis, the ear will protrude.

I then checked the other symptoms mentioned in the question and by the AI. I confirmed the child did have a fever, but this can be present in both Otitis and Mastoiditis. I then confirmed the meaning of postauricular pain, and as suspected, it's pain behind the ear. The NHS website confirmed that all of the above are Mastoiditis symptoms. It also mentioned that it's more likely to occur after a severe ear infection (I assume the Otitis was severe as it was treated by antibiotics, and the NHS website said middle ear infections don't always need antibiotic treatment).

The NHS website also mentioned that Mastoiditis may need a scan to diagnose, and that it should be diagnosed and treated quickly. This seemed to confirm that (B) was not the correct choice.

I then confirmed via the NHS website that the same listed symptoms are not also true for Otitis. Finally, assuming the child has suspected Mastoiditis, I double-confirmed that a CT scan would be the scan of choice for diagnosis.

Firstly, I looked up Miranda Rights and the Fifth Amendment to confirm that what I believed, and what the AI said, was true. This assertion, that this right protects individuals from incriminating themselves, seemed to confirm this.

But I wanted to check whether there was any chance of (A) being correct. I went back to the AI's response and looked up the hearsay rule, as it seems if the confession was admissible, it would be due to this.

My research seemed to indicate that no hearsay exceptions would apply to the out-of-court statement from accused A. 

But then I looked at the wording of the question. It was based on ""“the fact that accused B did not object or respond to accused A's accusatory statement"", rather than the statement itself. So what's important here is the fact they didn't respond, not the confession from accused A.

I looked up Miranda exceptions. This was a bit murky and the sources used a lot of legalese that was difficult to parse, but it became clear that the fact that accused B (apparently) hadn't explicitly waived their Miranda Rights might change things. They didn't assert their right to silence.

I then found a few instances where silence from the accused was accepted as incriminating, but it wasn't just simple silence by omitting to speak in these cases. It was silence when they had spoken previously, or silence with a change of demeanour, or silence when they'd be expected to ask about the wellbeing of others involved. This situation isn't the same – accused B just didn't speak.

I then tried to check whether it made a difference that the reading of the Miranda rights wasn't completed when accused A confessed. I didn't find any information on this, but I did find another website asserting that ""In a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the Court held in a 5-4 decision that in order to invoke the right to remain silent, one must do so unambiguously."" Accused B didn't do this.

I also read that ""statements are admissible as evidence against the suspect if they did not clearly invoke the right to remain silent or the right to an attorney."" But would silence count as a statement?

I had already run out of time a few minutes prior, so with two lingering questions that were very difficult to answer (is silence a statement, and did it matter that the Miranda rights reading wasn't finished?) I went back to the question page. 

As previously mentioned, the question asks ""whether the fact that accused B did not object or respond to accused A's accusatory statement"" – this would seem to rule out silence counting as a statement being of any importance.

(I will note that before making my final response, I did miss the AI's assertion ""The Supreme Court has ruled that a defendant's silence in response to an accusation cannot be used as evidence of guilt"" – maybe this would have been helpful, but given the above paragraph, maybe not.)

In the end, I wasn't convinced either way. Going by the wording of the question, I still think that (B) is most likely the correct response. But perhaps the fact that accused B didn't assert their right to silence overturns this. Due to my lack of confidence either way, I assigned my probability as 45/55.",B,

I quickly found that the double bubble sign indeed signifies duodenal atresia, as the AI asserted. This does affect the intestines, and the listed symptoms focused on feeding issues rather than breathing. This already suggested that (B) was far less likely.

I then looked up some of the newborn's symptoms: in simple terms, subcostal retractions means belly breathing, and cyanosis means blue lips. Both related to breathing and poor oxygen intake.

I then looked up the symptoms of of diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema in newborns. Cyanosis and difficulty or distress breathing were commonly listed across the search results.

I confirmed that yes, pulmonary edema in a newborn would be diagnosed via x-ray.

I then went back to look at the question and response to see whether there were any other points that I needed to research, before choosing my final answer. I noted that the question asks which finding is the ""most likely"" indication of a nonsurgical diagnosis. So, we don't even have to be absolutely certain here.

With this in mind, it's clear that (A) is by far the ""most likely"" indication. 

I did a final quick search to confirm the symptoms, which seemed to be repeated across search results, and this further confirmed that pulmonary edema is not necessarily a very rare problem in newborns. I then ended my research early.

I didn't know exactly what this meant although I had an idea, so I thought this would help prove myself and the AI either right or wrong.

The definitions that I found confirmed that this constitutional right is about the defendant being able to cross-examine witnesses in court.

But then I thought, well, the defendant can't confront a photograph, can they? I did some further research on what might run afoul of the Confrontation Clause, and found that some out-of-court statements (including reports), especially from nontestifying witnesses, might qualify. 

I went back to re-read the question and the AI's response, to check whether the proprietor and specialist were testifying. The former wasn't mentioned, but the specialist did testify to its accuracy. I also clarified to myself that (A) focuses on the use of infrared imaging, not the photograph itself. The AI states that the infrared imaging was a tool to gather evidence, not a witness (and that evidence has been validated as authentic).

So, I then looked up Confrontation Clause + evidence, and then followed a webpage link to the definition of a witness. I then did some further research on this, and concluded that a witness is generally required to be human (i.e. not a tool for gathering evidence). Some very rare exceptions may have been presented in the past, but these 'witnesses' were still alive, e.g. animals.

I then looked up photo evidence in court, and found that (as the AI had stated), the photograph would be admissible as it meets the two requirements of relevance and authenticity.

I then checked use of infrared technology as evidence in case there was a legal loophole there, but the only time thermal imaging appears to be an issue (from my research) is when privacy is being violated, e.g. police using thermal imaging on private residences. And in any case, (A)'s argument focused on confronting witnesses, not infrared imaging being disallowed.

By this point, I was confident that the AI was correct. It's reasoning made sense, and I couldn't disprove any of its points (nor could I prove that (A)'s argument was valid).

I then altered my search to remove the term ""written contract"", and found an LII webpage providing a definition of ""release"". Usually this website is good at providing understandable legal definitions, but in this case I don't think this page was relevant, ""release"" must have another meaning here.

I didn't have any luck reading up on the general definition of a contract on LII either, so I then looked up ""verbal alteration to written contract"". I found that verbal contract modifications can be challenging to prove in court, but while putting changes in writing is advised, it's not always required. 

I also noted that the website I used stated that contract modifications do require consideration.

I then found a website that specialised in US (albeit Florida-specific) construction law. It suggested that most legal problems in this area relate to verbal agreements that were made to alter written agreement. It also confirmed that if a contract doesn't state that verbal changes aren't allowed, a verbal change could be admissible: 

""A good rule of thumb is that if a verbal agreement or understanding contradicts an explicit term or subject in the contract it is inadmissible. If it does not, it may be admissible."" 

In this case, no explicit term relating to this is mentioned in regards to this particular contract. So I think the change would be admissible.

I then went back to the question page and noted that (A)'s reasoning is generic. ""Yes, because the release of a contractual obligation must be documented in writing."" – (A) does not state ""because IN THIS CONTRACT the release of..."". Given that I had just found multiple reliable sources that stated that contract changes DON'T always have to be in writing, I believe (A) is an incorrect statement. So it can't possibly be the right answer. 

Now, I had to prove (B) was correct, or at least do enough research to persuade myself that I couldn't disprove it.

I had already learned that modifications to a contract require consideration. I then found this information on the LII website: 

""Good faith modification: A modified contract is a kind of new agreement, which changes parties’ obligations and then requires new consideration. But contract modification made in good faith under UCC is enforceable even without consideration.""

So not only does a contract change require consideration, but it must be NEW consideration, unless it's made under UCC. 

My next step was to research UCC, and I found that UCC relates only to provision of goods; provision of services would fall under common law, not UCC.

Therefore, this contract modification would have required new consideration. But the consideration was not new; the previous consideration of $200k was maintained. The AI's statement that this could be considered consideration for the removal of the pavement installation duty is incorrect.

At this point, I was quite sure I had proved the AI incorrect, as new consideration would be a requirement, and (A) seems to be an incorrect statement. I concluded my research just a couple of minutes early, and set my probability at 20/80, because my reasoning for (A) is dependent on how it is worded rather than definitive knowledge of the contract terms, although I am still very certain that (B) is correct.",B,

I thought X expected to get the orchard as he already thought Z had the title, since it mentioned that he wasn't aware of the legal situation.

I started by researching quitclaim deeds, since I didn't know what this was. I found confirmation of what the AI said around a quitclaim deed not guaranteeing that the grantor has any particular interest in the property. (But, if someone believes a quitclaim deed was used to illegally transfer a property, it can be challenged in court.)

With that out of the way, I then looked up contract estoppel. So rather than this being about promissory estoppel, which I had remembered from a previous question, estoppel in this case would prevent X from renouncing the validity of the contract.

I then looked up contract+renunciation+estoppel, and found that ""generally, a party asserting estoppel must have “clean hands,” or be free from fault”. I'm not sure that Z is free from fault here, but this would explain why the AI seemed unsure of her victory.

I then researched contract acceptance via initial payment. On Law Stackexchange, someone asserted that yes, payment indicates contract acceptance, and gave examples that made sense to me. But, a contract acceptance generally hasn’t occurred if the offer is based on lies – did Z lie?

I then realised that this probably comes down to wording, so I revisited the question, the answers, and the AI's response.

(A) is worded that X ""deliberately"" negotiated the quitclaim deed ""in anticipation"" of securing the orchard – but as the AI asserts, he didn’t know of the legal situation, he wasn’t ""deliberately"" trying to get it knowing Z had no claim. And this would have been impossible to prove anyway, because the quitclaim deed doesn't guarantee Z even has a claim, so a quitclaim can't be used in this manner. This means that (A) can't possibly be the correct answer.

(B) seemed more likely at this point. By making a payment, X accepted the contract – as my online research found, this is how most contracts work. No need to even sign anything. It's a quitclaim, so if he did his due diligence and understood the terms, he'd have understood that Z didn't necessarily have a claim to transfer, so he wouldn't necessarily get anything. But he made that initial payment anyway.

Z already did her part by the time X made that payment. Z had already transferred 'her claim' on the property, whatever that may (or may not) be. So, contrary to my initial understanding, it's X who is 'in the wrong', as should have known what he was getting into when he willingly made that initial payment. 

My final probability of 15/85 reflects the fact that my reasoning is mostly based on how this was worded.",A,

I started by researching hearsay exceptions. It took a few attempts to make sense of the double-negative, legalese wording I was encountering, but I gathered that this probably wouldn't count as an exception to the hearsay rule due to it being a present sense impression (since it happened a while after the party), an excited utterance (it wasn't), and not an admission of a party opponent (I clarified that this means the person opposing the defendant in the trial, which the copassenger isn't). There were other exceptions listed but none looked likely.

I then went back to the AI's reasoning, and checked whether a hearsay rule exception could apply when ""a statement is against the declarant's interest"". It would, but I don't think it would apply here. The copassenger isn't the one on trial here, they are a potential witness, that's all. (Although I'd imagine one could get into trouble for knowingly allowing their driver to drink-drive.)

So, still thinking that (A) was the most plausible answer, since it probably wasn't a hearsay exception, I went about disproving (B). I read the LII definition of relevant evidence, and thought that the statement probably met that definition, as it ""tends to make a fact more probable than it would be"".

Then I went back to read the question. (By the way, was the copassenger a robot? I don't believe a human who had been drinking would make that statement in those actual words!)

As previously noted, the question stated that the copassenger was ready and willing to give their testimony during the court trial. So wouldn't that be testimony then, rather than hearsay? I did some research around this, and found that if the copassenger delivered the information that they had come from a party where everyone had been drinking as testimony in court, this could not be hearsay. I think the only way it could be hearsay would be if the copassenger limited their testimony to ""yes, I made that statement to the officer at the scene"". But why would they come into court just to say that and not give their version of events?

I then noted from the question that the court was eager to have the OFFICER recount the statement, not the copassenger. And the question asks about the copassenger's TESTIMONY. So from this, I gather they did deliver testimony, so it isn't the statement that is in question.

Finally, I thought about their statement. How could it be irrelevant? Well, although they said everyone at the party had been drinking, they didn't say the DRIVER was at the party. The driver could have been a taxi driver, or just a friend who collected them from the party but didn't actually attend. When they made that statement, it was out of earshot of the driver (so they had no opportunity to clarify that they weren't there), and it could have been given for another reason, i.e. to explain why the driver had come to pick them up (because copassenger had been drinking). 

I concluded that, not knowing whether the driver had been at the party, and considering the wording of (B) ""Not admissible, due to the fact it could POTENTIALLY steer..."", (B) is most likely the correct response. 

I kept my probability low, at 45/55, because it is not known whether the driver was at the party, or whether the copassenger is testifying only to confirm that they made that statement at the scene and nothing more. I think (A) is still possible, but (B) is more likely. 

(I also think the officer should have just breathalysed the driver at the scene.)",A,

I found that while yes, it is invasive, it was noted that it's a good alternative to a CT scan when the patient is unstable or uncooperative, as you'd need to sedate them for a CT scan. Also, DPL is quicker than a CT scan. Since the patient is described as having cognitive impairment, I conclude that he's conscious and likely unstable (as in, might not be able to keep still).

I then looked up what a GCS score of 10 means. This would indicate a moderate brain injury. Another indication that he might be considered unstable.

I then noted his pelvic fractures and looked up a visual of the ischal rami. I concluded that if both sides of his pelvis are broken, he's not going to be comfortable lying in a CT scanner for a prolonged period of time.

I then looked up how long an abdominal CT scan takes. It ""should take less than 30 minutes"" (so it's not short), you must hold still the whole time, and you may need to hold your breath. 

I don't think this patient is in a state to be able to do any of these things.

I also noted that he's obese, and while his weight isn't stated, some CT scanners can't take more than 135kg.

I then reread the AI's response for any more clues, although I was now leaning heavily towards (A).

It noted that DPL isn't good on an unstable patient, so I looked that up. I found that DPL is used on patients for whom clinical exam of abdomen is unreliable due to traumatic brain injury or multiple associated injuries, both of which the patient has. I did note that morbid obesity can be a relative contraindication to DPL, but the question doesn’t state that he’s morbidly obese, and if he were, would he be able to work a physical job like bricklaying?

I then saw a sentence that sealed my decision. CT scanning requires a ""hemodynamically normal patient"". I double-checked, and due to his blood loss, heart rate and BP, this patient is definitely not hemodynamically normal.

I then confirmed via the NIH website that ""In a hemodynamically abnormal patient, if FAST is unavailable or results are equivocal, DPL is indicated.""

I ran over time a bit (although I believe that's permitted). I also got called away part-way through; I paused the video then but forgot to pause the timer.)

I firstly researched Rule 608(b), which the AI had referenced. The wording seemed to concur with what the AI had said: specific instances of conduct may be inquired into on cross-examination if they are probative of the character for un/truthfulness of the witness.

I checked the meaning of ""probative"", and my understanding was correct – it means having the quality of proving or demonstrating something.

This Rule 608 does have exceptions and a lot of notes, however. I don't think this is as straightforward as the AI is making it out to be, and the legalese is difficult to parse.

I decided it was quicker to take the alternative route and look up character evidence.

I first got caught up reading about character evidence in criminal and federal cases, then realised this probably doesn't apply. I think, from my research, that this would be a common law case. I then realised that some of the information on character evidence was about plaintiffs or defendants' characters, not witnesses. Everything seemed to circle back to Rule 608.

I did find that ""Evidence of a witness’s character may be admitted under rules 607, 608 & 609"", but rules 607 & 609 related specifically to impeachment and criminal witnesses. These didn't seem relevant; I was back to Rule 608. So far the AI seems to be correct.

I tried again to research around 'witness character evidence'. It was back to Rule 608 again, but I noticed something. Rule 608 states:

""the court may, on cross-examination, allow [specific instances of conduct] to be inquired into if they are probative of the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of:

(1) the witness; or

(2) another witness whose character the witness being cross-examined has testified about.""

My understanding here is that the second point indicates that the character evidence could be obtained by cross-examining the witness themself, OR someone else.

As I type this I'm now doubting myself, but I took this to mean that (B) could not be true, as it states that the evidence could ONLY be obtained by cross-examining the expert witness. 

(However I'm now realising that this might still apply, as no other witnesses are mentioned, and the respondent who knows about this evidence is a defendant, not a witness.)

I then concluded that (A) might be possible if the judge decided that the character evidence was irrelevant or misleading. The expert witness was giving evidence on finances; it's not clear what type of false testimony they gave previously (whether financial or otherwise) or even whether it was their own marital dissolution proceedings or that of the respondent.

I also noted that in this case, they are an expert witness, but they wouldn't have been an expert witness if it was their own marital dissolution proceedings. 

I wasn't sure if either of those last two points would be relevant, as I was unable to find information about irrelevant witness character evidence during my research.

Due to my understanding that (B) could not be true as it excluded the possibility of other witnesses being cross-examined, I tentatively chose (A) as the correct answer.

I then looked up Lojban sentence structure. I learned that the 'selbri' in a sentence would probably compare to English verbs (but it wouldn't always be a 1:1 comparison with English). I then learned that the selbri does not have to be the last word in a sentence, although it would sit towards the end. I'm going to ignore this part of the AI's explanation.

I then looked up ""carna"". I should have done this first, because the definition of ""to turn about a vector"" clearly excludes (B) from being the possible response. This is a physical turning, not a 'becoming' turning, as the apple does when it turns red.

I confirmed that ""co'a"" does indeed mean ""to become"". 

I realised that perhaps the way in which Lojban sentences are put together means that ""co'a xunre"" might indeed serve as a type of verb ""to redden"" (which would mean the verb comes last), but this wasn't relevant so I didn't look into this further.

After reconfirming the definitions of both words in another Lojban-English dictionary with example sentences, I was 100% sure that (A) was the correct answer. I concluded my research early, and set my probability at 100/0.",A,

""klaku"" means weeps/cries tears.
""krixa"" means cries out/yells/howls sound.

This seems to prove the AI correct. However, I do consider that both verbs are possible actions at a funeral, but klaku is more likely. If I could do nothing but weep, I wouldn’t be howling or crying out. Although in this case ""krixa"" could mean I could do nothing but howl.

I then confirmed the definitions in another Lojban-English dictionary, checking example sentences. It confirmed that ""klaku"" is to weep, and suggested that ""krixa"" is more of a ""cry out/shout/yell"" action. 

Going by context, we'd expect weeping at a funeral much more than shouting or yelling, but again, both are possible.

I reread the question. It's asking about the correct translation from the English, not which verb is more likely to be correct in Lojban. In English, ""cry"" means to ""weep"", not to ""shout/yell/howl"" etc. ""Cry out"" could mean those things, but in the context of the sentence, we can assume that ""cry"" means ""weep"".

So, (A) is the correct definition, since ""klaku"" means to ""weep"". (B) is an incorrect translation.

2024-06-27 16:51:50.425,ILNLS,25,50.0,50.0,Before reading the AI's answer: A (Wait and watch): 50%; B (Organising an abdominal CT scan): 50%,I had no idea.,60.0,40.0,After reading the AI's answer: A (Wait and watch): 60%; B (Organising an abdominal CT scan): 40%,The AI's explanation was persuasive; I just needed to prove it right (or not).,15.0,85.0,After my research: A (Wait and watch): 15%; B (Organising an abdominal CT scan): 85%,B,"I started by researching Varicoceles, which the AI stated was the most likely cause. I found that this usually occurs on the left-hand side of the scrotum, but occurrence on the right-hand side is possible (as with this patient). I also noted that Varicoceles most often occurs during puberty, but this patient is 45, and only noticed the mass a week previously.

Multiple websites throughout my research confirmed that the ""bag of worms"" descriptions seems to fit Varicoceles.

I then decided to make my search more specific: """"bag of worms"" mass on scrotum right”.

The Johns Hopkins medical website provided some important information:

""if a varicocele forms on the right side and not the left, it is important to make sure there is no mass or other abnormality in the abdomen that might be causing it.”

This contradicts the AI's advice, and also seems to suggest an abdominal CT scan is appropriate.

The same website also stated:

""When a varicocele doesn’t reduce [when a patient is lying down], it also raises concern that there is an abdominal blockage such as a mass or tumor that could be causing the mass.""

It is mentioned in the description that the mass remains the same when the patient lies down. Again, there's a suggestion of an abdominal blockage, which would presumably require an abdominal CT scan to diagnose.

I then did some further research with the aim of confirming this information. I was now quite sure that the AI was wrong. I didn't find much information to confirm what the Johns Hopkins website had said, but I'm aware that a lot of public-facing medical websites take care to limit information that might cause unnecessary distress to patients researching their symptoms, and the information I had found previously went a little beyond the reassuring, 'need to know' facts.

I did eventually find a statement on WebMD that confirmed that the mass should disappear when the patient lies down. Multiple other websites confirmed that it tends to occur on the left hand side, and in younger patients (but this is not absolute).

I then decided to research CT scan radiation risk, since this was one of the AI's reasons for not getting a scan. A couple of academic and medical websites suggested that for a one-off CT scan, the overall risk from radiation is low.

At this stage, given what I had read on the Johns Hopkins website, and knowing that the CT scan didn't pose a significant risk, I decided that the AI was definitely incorrect.

I set my probability at 15/85 as although I was certain, this was based mostly on a single (albeit trustworthy) website, rather than having been backed up by many sources.",B,

I found that while the listed symptoms seemed to match what the AI was saying, I suspected they were quite generic and could indicate other conditions as well.

I then decided to research the listed symptoms individually, and understood that:
- The patient does not have fever
- His BP is high
- His HR is high-ish
- I think his white blood cell count is high, but it was tricky to tell as the web page didn't render the character encoding correctly.

I then researched ""dilated bowel loops"". The symptoms of this again seemed to match, but were all generic. I decided to research the two treatment options instead.

I quickly discovered that (A) erythromycin is an antibiotic, used for treating infections. The patient does not have fever, which I know usually indicates infection, so it doesn't seem like this is the problem here.

While erythromycin can be used to stimulate the bowels, I doubt that an antibiotic would be used for this instead of a purpose-made laxative. And if the patient has a bowel obstruction, stimulating the bowels might not help and could be dangerous. 

I did also find that erythromycin is used to treat gastoparesis, but the patient's problem is with the bowels, not the stomach, so this isn't relevant.

I then researched (B) Nasogastric tube decompression. I found this this is definitely a treatment for bowel blockages, as the AI asserted.

So then I decided to determine whether the patient most likely has a bowel blockage.

""Dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels"" does, according to my research, suggest bowel obstruction. Bilious vomiting, which the patient is also experiencing, is also a sign of SBO. Although it has other causes, none seemed to fit the scenario, and I saw no indication that bilious vomiting would indicate an infection.

I was then feeling quite sure that (B) was correct, but decided to go back and check whether anything came up for SBO+Erythromycin. While it seems that this drug can be used to prevent SBO, e.g. after surgery, it isn't used as a treatment, except possibly in cases of pseudo obstruction (which this isn't).

Finally, I confirmed that gastrointestinal decompression is suggested for patients ""with significant distension, nausea, and/or vomiting"" – which our patient has.

I set my probabilities at 20/80 since I didn't 'prove' that the patient had SBO, although it seems quite certain (and lack of fever may rule out infection). Assuming SBO, I had confirmed that (B) would definitely be the best next step in terms of treatment.",B,

It was difficult to find the relevant section, as the websites I had accessed all used 'legalese' and were full of jargon that I couldn't understand easily.

I eventually found a website that explained the UCC terms in plain English. It confirmed that:

""the seller will deliver the goods to their own place of business as long as the goods aren't known by both parties to be kept somewhere else.""

And that the seller must then hold onto the goods until the buyer can pick them up. This seems to confirm the 'delivery' part of the answer.

I then checked the same website for the buyer's obligations RE payment:

""The general rule is that the buyer must accept and pay for the goods when the seller has delivered—or, to use more technical language, ""tendered delivery of""—the goods.""

And, importantly:

""More particularly, the UCC indicates that by default and unless otherwise agreed to:
the seller's delivery of the goods and the buyer's payment for the goods are expected to happen at the same time.""

Since the payment must take place at the same time as delivery, this would suggest that (B) is correct.

However, I then noticed that the buyer can hold off payment until they've ""accepted"" the goods, i.e. had time to inspect them first to check they aren't defective. The buyer would by default need to inspect the goods at the seller's location, but they can do so at ""any reasonable place and time"".

These are bathroom sets, so they might take a while to inspect. I decided to search UCC wording specifically around the term ""reasonable timeframe"", but didn't find relevant results.

The nice, understandable website didn't say anything about payment within a reasonable period of time if it wasn't agreed. I decided to go back to the wording of the question and answers.

Although we know that the seller IS obligated to deliver 25 sets on March 1, this doesn't necessarily mean (A) is correct. Since the website I had visited earlier stated that ""the seller's delivery of the goods and the buyer's payment for the goods are expected to happen at the same time”, this suggests that (B) is more correct. If the buyer doesn't present payment at the same time, it's breaching the UCC rules, so I assume then the seller wouldn't be obligated to deliver under UCC.

I tried again to confirm some of the UCC details, and found that:

""2-310. Open Time for Payment or Running of Credit; Authority to Ship Under Reservation.
o	Unless otherwise agreed
o	(a) payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods even though the place of shipment is the place of delivery""

Although this had the same caveat that the buyer may inspect the goods first, it didn't use wording around paying within a reasonable timeframe.

I then researched what would be a commercially reasonable time under UCC. I found that:

""2-309: The time for shipment or delivery or any other action under a contract if not provided in this Article or agreed upon shall be a reasonable time.""

Payment would constitute ""any other action"", but the time for payment was specified in the UCC Article 2 (Sales) as being by default at the time of delivery, so I assume this 2-309 clause would not apply.

I decided that this easily confusable information may have caused the AI to hallucinate its statement regarding payment that  ""a reasonable time is implied if not specified.""

I set my final answer as (B), and I set my probability at 40/60 because this was tricky to research, and although I believe I've found the right answer, there's still some ambiguity around the buyer being allowed to pay after inspection of goods, and how long that might take.",B,

If the AI's definitions were correct, then Lojban translation (B) would indeed be the incorrect answer:

(B) smaji co'u | lo nu | lo cipni | co'a cmoni
The quietness ends | (turns bridi into a noun) | the birds | start sing
“the quietness ends [the noun of the birds starting to sing]” 

(I showed my document on-screen in the video a few times as I worked through the sentences.)

I then looked up the missing words/particles in sentence (A) that the AI had not defined in its explanation ('ku' and 'cu'). I just used a Lojban dictionary and Wiktionary for this; I did try to read up on a grammar usage website and on Reddit, but as Lojban vocabulary was used, I didn't understand these explanations.

I found that 'ku' works as a terminator. I assume then that in its use below, it terminates the verb co'u (to end) so that it applies to the quietness, not what comes next (after 'ku').

I then found that 'cu' is a separator. I wasn't too sure how this worked, but I assumed it helped turn ""the noun of the birds singing"" into ""birdsong"".

My translation for (A) now looked correct:

(A)	smaji co'u | ku | co'a | lo nu | lo cipni | cu | cmoni
the quietness ends | [terminator/end desc] | start | (turns bridi into a noun) | the birds | (separator) | sing
“the quietness ends, the birdsong starts”

I then checked the definitions of the other Lojban words, not wanting to take the AI at its word. The AI's definitions proved correct.

I found that an omission which renders statements misleading may constitute a misrepresentation – this seems to fit what happened.

I wasn't as certain that the description of ""fraudulent misrepresentation"" fit the scenario (the AI had mentioned this as well), but in this case I think either of the 'misrepresentations' mentioned could apply and the buyer would win.

I then decided to research option (B). An ""oppressively unfair"" contract in the US would be one that is declared ""unconscionable"". Going by the descriptions I read, I don't believe this contract was unconscionable. Although ""abuses"" did take place by the dealer during the contract's formation, I don't think the buyer had an absence of meaningful choice, as they did have the option to have a mechanic inspect the vehicle. Also, according to the LII website:

""A contract is most likely to be found unconscionable if both unfair bargaining and unfair substantive terms are shown.""

Nothing is mentioned in the description of the contract terms being unfair.

I then looked up what would be needed to rescind a contract in the US.

I did end up on Wikipedia, which I'm aware isn't always the most reliable source, but the language there was easier to understand. I found (again) that a contract can be rescinded due to misrepresentation, described as:

""To amount to a misrepresentation, the statement must be untrue or seriously misleading. A statement which is ""technically true"" but which gives a misleading impression is deemed an ""untrue statement"".

The dealer's statement, according to this description, would definitely be ""untrue"". And since misrepresentation is a valid reason to rescind a contract (which the buyer is trying to do), (A) seems even more likely to be the correct answer at this point.

I then looked up ""misrepresentation by omission"", as the dealer had omitted the detail about the car being in an accident, and this is what the wording in (A) focuses on.

According to LII: ""A misrepresentation is a false or misleading statement or a material omission"" – so yes, misrepresentation definitely applies in this case, I've just double (or triple) confirmed it.

I did wonder about whether the part of (A) that reads ""and evidence of the accident was hidden by the dealer"" was important, as yes the dealer did hide the evidence, but one would expect them to repair and repaint the car before selling it – I'm sure this isn't a problem. I assume in this case, the ""hiding of evidence"" again would be through the combination of both physical repair and verbal omission. 

I reread what makes a contract unconscionable, just in case I had missed anything, but I still agree that the terms weren't unfair, and as the AI pointed out, the buyer had the option to have a mechanic inspect the vehicle. The Wikipedia definition of unconscionability uses words like ""extreme"" and ""no reasonable or informed person would otherwise agree to it"", which I didn't feel applied in this case.

""Nail polish"" is a compound word. Technically, nail polish doesn't ""polish"" the nail like, say, furniture polish does; this would be closer to nail buffing. Nail polish does decorate the nail, though.

I tried looking up ""varnish"" as ""nail varnish"" is sometimes used as a synonym for ""nail polish"", but ""varnish"" is another word entirely in Lojban.

I then looked up ""paint"", since nail polish does ""paint"" the nail. But again, ""paint"" is a separate word in Lojban, and not one of our two choices.

I then looked up ""spali"" and ""jadni"" in another Lojban dictionary in the hope that it would have some example sentences involving nail polish, but had no luck there.

I then checked what types of words ""jadni"" and ""spali"" are in Lojban. Both are gismu, so this didn't help. I had thought that perhaps if jadni had exclusively been a verb, for example, this would have provided a clue. But I don't think I can eliminate or do further helpful research based on grammar.

I then simply tried searching on 'Lojban + ""nail polish""' in case I had any luck. I did find what I believe to be a translation! Unfortunately, that translation used another term for polish (""grasu,"" also a gismu), which translates to English as ""oil"". 

So if this translation is to be believed (and I do trust it, since it is in an official Lojban publication, and Lojban is designed not to be ambiguous), ""nail polish"" translates to ""nail oil"" in Lojban.

This did help. The question only asks which is the ""better"" translation, not which is ""correct"".

""Polish"", as a tangible thing, is much closer to ""oil"" than an ""adornment"" is. 

Yes, nail polish is technically an adornment of the nails, but ""jgalu grasu"" from the Lojban publication does not directly translate to ""nail polish"", while ""jgalu spali"" does.

Finally, the focus of the sentence is on the smell. Polish (in general) is known to be a smelly substance. A decoration could be anything; if I think ""decoration"" I don't immediately think ""smelly"". I think in this sentence, ""jgalu spali"" is a better translation of ""nail polish"", because it emphasises the smell. And other nail adornments do exist (sequins, stickers etc) that do not smell.

Therefore, I think the correct answer is (A). I set my probability at 70/30 because I didn't definitively prove this either way. (And what consists of a ""better"" translation could be subjective, given neither are apparently the ""correct"" translation!)",B,

From the LII website, I found that:

""A contract implied in fact consists of obligations arising from a mutual agreement expressed not through words but implied through actions.""

This was of interest, as the note seems to me more like ""words"" than ""actions"". The lawyer simply came across the paper; it doesn't expressly mention that it was posted, faxed or emailed to him, which I'd see as more of an ""action"". I wondered if I was barking up the wrong tree, however.

I then found another LII entry for ""contract implied in fact"" – the former page was ""implied contract"". I wondered if these were different legal concepts, but a later search showed that they probably pertain to the same thing (but the ""implied contract"" page refers to both ""implied in fact"" and ""implied in law"" contracts).

I did find some interesting information on this LII ""contract implied in fact"" page however:

""To establish the existence of an implied in fact contract, it is necessary to show:
o	An unambiguous offer, 
o	Unambiguous acceptance, 
o	Mutual intent to be bound, and
o	Consideration""

I don't believe any of these conditions were met. Maybe by conducting the work, the lawyer met ""unambiguous acceptance"". And maybe, if the legal firm had some sort of price list, the ""consideration"" could have been assumed by default. But the note didn't mention consideration, and as the client is asserting, it didn't present an unambiguous offer or mutual intent to be bound.

I decided at this point that (A) seemed the less likely option. But how to research (B)?

I tried researching things like ""US contract action disadvantage"", but couldn't find anything relevant. I couldn't think of how to phrase this in a way to get relevant results.

I went back down the route of trying to disprove (A) instead.

I tried ""US implied-in-fact contract unenforceable"", and also tried searches using the term ""no value"", as the LII had mentioned earlier that:

""However, under some circumstances, even if a defendant has received nothing of value, the implied-in-fact contract can still be enforced.""

But again, I didn't find anything of use. I did find an Investopedia definition of contract implied-in-fact (I like this website because it uses plain English), which backed up the LII description by stating that this type of contract requires an offer and acceptance of the offer, mutual agreement, and consideration. Again, I don't think these terms were met.

Perhaps if a precedence had been mentioned (if the lawyer had done this type of work for the client before on a regular basis) it would have steered me back to (A), but there's no indication of this. Writing up a will is a different type of work to checking a contract, and I don't think the two are comparable.

Finally, I found this, also on Investopedia:

""Implied-in-fact assumes that parties understand the terms of the agreement and what actions must be taken.""

Again, there was no indication that both parties understood any terms.

I then thought about when mi'a might be applied. Could it be applied here? After all, the English phrase doesn't say ""let's watch the sunset *together*"".

Assuming this phrase was spoken, I don't think there's any ambiguity – the listener is clearly included as they are the one being spoken to, and ""let's"" is used.

But what if it were written? That same phrase in a book would refer to characters, but not the reader. Would the reader count as the listener here? Maybe not if it were dialogue in a book, but I thought it was worth checking.

I decided to verify the definitions of the other Lojban words in the sentence, mostly to check whether any were described by the dictionary as ""literary"" words (hinting at a book context), but also to confirm the AI was correct.

I found that the definitions matched the AI's assertions, and the concept of any being ""literary"" was not mentioned.

I then searched on literary vs spoken Lojban. This took me to the Wikipedia page, which asserted that Lojban is a *spoken* and unambiguous language, and that there isn't a lot of Lojban literature in existence. I assume then, that there is one standard version of Lojban, and therefore, even if this phrase did come from a book, there is no way that ""mi'a"" (B) could apply.

I set my probability at 80/20 because while I was quite certain, there's ultimately no way of knowing the context in which the phrase was uttered. In the context of it being standalone though, I do think it's clear that the correct answer is (A).",A,

I firstly looked up 'circumferential neck burn' as I thought this might mention something about the airway – I also wasn't sure what it meant (whether the burn was internal or external etc). It means the patient received burns all the way around the outside of the neck, but there was no indication that it necessitated an endotracheal tube.

I then looked up fluid resus for burns, and quickly found the following on the NIH website:

“It is a widely accepted fact that severe fluid loss is the greatest problem faced following major burn injuries [over 20%].”

I then read up on burn shock, as this seemed to be the AI's main concern. This tends to peak around 6-8 hours after the injury, but is better prevented than treated. Physiopedia confirmed that in patients with burn injuries over 20%, proper fluid resus is crucial within the first 24hrs after the injury.

However, I then read that haemodynamically stable patients may not benefit from fluid resus as this could lead to oedema. I checked whether the patient would be considered stable, according to his vital stats. His BP is normal, but his HR is on the higher end of normal. His respiratory rate is high. But I'm not sure whether this is important as an abnormal vital sign (necessitating fluid resus), or a sign of breathing difficulty (necessitating intubation).

I then looked up ""occasional premature ventricular contractions"". This isn't normally a cause for concern, but can indicate an electrolyte imbalance (which I suspect fluid resus would address) or stress and anxiety. If the patient is conscious, I bet he's stressed.

I'm still unsure which should come first. I'm not sure if he needs the tube, and I know he most likely needs the fluid resus. Even if his vitals aren't too abnormal, he has a very high % of burns.

I looked up how long it takes to insert an endotracheal tube. This should only take 30 seconds, so it's not going to delay the fluid resus by long. But does he need it? Won't it create discomfort and stress him out further if he doesn't need it?

I then found an NHS website that discussed how paramedic and hospital staff should assess patients presenting with burn injuries. It suggests that ambulance staff should begin to administer fluids if the ride to the hospital is likely to take over an hour – so they do need to get on it, fast. 

Meanwhile, although assessing breathing was a priority on the checklist, our patient didn't seem to meet any of the criteria listed that would necessitate ""early intubation"". 

After assessment of the wound is complete (this has already been done this in the question, as it's been assessed that the patient is at 43% burns), the next step from the NHS website is IV fluid resus for any patient with burns over 20%. Checking smoke inhalation injuries is the *next* step after that – and we can't do that if there's a tube down his throat, surely?

At this point, the timer was up, and I didn't feel that any further research would necessarily throw up new information. I kept my probability at 40/60 in favour of (B), because all the websites emphasised the importance of fluid resus soon after the burn injury, and because of how the patient did not appear to be having breathing difficulties. However, I wasn't able to conclusively prove that this is the correct next step, and given how quick it would be to intubate (and the patient's high breathing rate), I still have my doubts.",A,

Yes, going by the description, the driver's statement that was recounted by the officer would fall under the definition of hearsay.

The AI made the argument that it could be excluded from the hearsay rule as an excited utterance, but going by the definition, I don't think this applies. It wasn't said in the heat of the moment – the driver followed the car to the fast-food restaurant, then went to seek out the officer.

The other listed exceptions don't apply either – it's not a ""statement against interest"" on the driver's part, and it's not a matter of record.

I followed some other links on the LII website, to get more detail.

Another exception to the hearsay rule is the ""present sense impression"". I wonder about this for a moment, but then, on re-reading the question, I see that the driver made the statement to the officer 10 minutes after the accident. So it's not a present sense impression either.

At this point, I'm sure this is hearsay, and that none of the exceptions apply, making (A) the correct answer. But I decide to research (B) to disprove it.

I find that, according to LII:

“Unfair prejudice” within its context means an undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis, commonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one."" 

I don’t think someone approaching the officer to report a crime is an “improper basis"", and I don't think the officer presenting information that directly relates to the charge is improper, either.

I then find a document on the Indiana University website that reads:

“In order for a danger to “substantially” outweigh probative value, the probative value must be pretty small, i.e., be of little or no relevance to begin with. You can’t exclude evidence that a child was molested as unfairly prejudicial if the defendant is on trial for that act.""

This is the same. This is evidence that the defendant hit a person with their car, and the defendant is on trial for hitting that person with their car. So this can't be excluded as prejudicial. It's also not overly emotional evidence, as per the other sections of the Prejudice Rule.

I re-read the question and answer one more time. Yes, this is definitely hearsay. It even mentions that the driver was ""anonymous"" and ""unidentified"". And yes, the driver's statement was relevant, and not unfair, given that the officer then found the driver, as described, in the same car in the same fast food car park afterwards.

I'm 100% confident that the correct answer is (A).",A,

I did this in a separate doc on my other screen, and I showed it in the video a few times as I worked on it.

I first decided to tackle the definition of ""zmanei"". The Lojban dictionary entry for this word appeared to be very complicated! I'm not sure if it's a compound term, or if other terms are compounded from this one, but it does seem to be related to ""liking"" something, as well as ""preferring"" something.

""Nelmau"" proved even tricker to define. A Lojban dictionary entry doesn't seem to exist for this word. After some searching, I eventually found a Lojban glossary that defined ""-mau"" as ""-more-than"". I assume here, then, that ""-mau"" is a suffix attached to ""nel-"" to indicate ""something-more-than"". 

To my understanding, ""-mau"" works like this for the following compound words, so I'm assuming it applies this way here:

“citno” means “young”, and “citmau” = “is younger than”
""gleki” is happy, and “gekmau” = “is happier than”

Going back to the ""zmanei"" definition, this word appears related to another word, ""nelci"", meaning ""is fond of"". 

""nel(ci)"" + ""mau"" = ""is fond of-more than"" (""nelmau"")?

I had, in the meantime, looked up the other word definitions, and had completed a rough parsed English translation of both sentences:

(A) la .mark. | cu | zmanei | lo’e | tcati | la .djein.

= Mark | (separator) | prefers | (descriptor) | tea | Jane

(B) la .mark. | cu | nelmau | la .djein. | lo'e | tcati

= Mark | (separator) | likes-more-than? | Jane | (descriptor) | tea 

Lojban sentences are formed in the order subject-verb-object.

Mark is the subject.
Likes (or, here, ""likes-more-than-Jane"") is the verb.
Tea is the object.

Therefore, the structure of (B) would make most sense as a translation. 

I set my probability at 40/60 because I definitely did not prove this beyond any doubt, and ""zmanei"" does appear to be related not just to ""liking"" but to ""preferring"" as well. However, ""preferring"" is different to ""more than"" – Mark doesn't ""prefer"" tea over Jane here (and Jane isn't the object of the sentence in English). I'm fairly confident that (B) is the correct translation.",B,

""The qualifications for a child to provide testimony include the following:
-	sufficient intelligence, understanding, and ability to observe, recall, and communicate events;
-	an ability to comprehend the seriousness of an oath; and
-	an appreciation of the necessity to tell the truth.""

Then, the LII website stated (*emphasis* my own):

o	""*A child is presumed to be competent.*
o	A competency examination regarding a child witness may be conducted by the court *only upon written motion and offer of proof of incompetency by a party*.
o	A competency examination regarding a child may be conducted *only if the court determines, on the record, that compelling reasons exist*. *A child’s age alone is not a compelling reason*.
o	Psychological and psychiatric examinations to assess the competency of a child witness *shall not be ordered without a showing of compelling need*.""

The first statement from the publication supports both answers (since proving the child is capable isn't mentioned, but ""qualifications"" might imply this), but the LII information clearly supports (A), since the question does not mention any challenge to the child's presumed competence. It seems as if ""compelling evidence"" isn't needed.

I then looked again at the AI's response. Its reasoning for (A) being incorrect is that it doesn't mention the need to assess a child's ability to provide a reliable testimony. But, as we've established, proof isn't needed, and the wording ""delivering a truthful account"" covers the ""truthful testimony"" part (just without using the same words).

I then searched on. A US government website stated that children are automatically allowed to testify under 601 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, which states that every person is competent to be a witness. However, some states hold that hold that children below certain ages, usually 10, 12, or 14, are presumptively incompetent unless determined otherwise. I decided to disregard that latter piece of information, as no state is mentioned in the question, so I assume that I should go by the Federal law.

The same government website then went on:

""To testify, a child must have certain characteristics, including the capacity to observe, sufficient intelligence, adequate memory, the ability to communicate, an awareness of the difference between truth and falsehood, and an appreciation of the obligation to tell the truth.""

And, ""The burden of proof rests on the party challenging the child's capacity to testify.""

The former statement here supports all of the points mentioned in (A), and the latter statement shows again that someone needs to challenge the child's ability to testify – which isn't mentioned in the question.

I then found the same information (just worded differently) on another website. The process of establishing that the child is competent was also described – the judge gently presents basic questions the child, to determine a base level of intelligence and communication skills, and the ability to recall events and distinguish between truth and lies.

At this point, it was clear that (B) is the incorrect answer, as no ""compelling evidence"" is needed. I set my probability at 100/0, and concluded my research early.",A,

I did this in a separate doc in another window, and I showed this doc in the video several times as I made progress.

I looked up the English definition of each Lojban word as it came in sentence (A), and added the words in translation below each sentence. Once I had translated (A), I looked up ""ku"" to complete my translation of (B).

""Ku"" was difficult to apply to the sentence as I learned that it's a terminator/negator, but I wasn't sure whether it would apply to what came before or after it in the sentence.

In the meantime, I revisited the question and the AI's response, and further refined my parsed translation through use of another dictionary, the glossary, and a webpage on Lojban grammar.

I ended up with:

(A)	do | gleki | co'a | lo nu | ra | mo'u | jukpa
You | happy | became | event | they | end | cook

= you became happy when they finished cooking

(B) do | gleki | co'a | ku | mo'u | lo nu | ra | jukpa
You | happy | became | terminator/negator of desc. | end | event | they | cook

= you stopped being happy when they finished cooking ?
= you became happy when they stopped the event of finishing cooking?

I think for (B), the first translation would likely apply as ""you became happy"" is more of a description than ""they finished cooking"". So this would be incorrect. But even if the second translation is true, (A) appears to translate more directly and seems to make more sense.

I did spend some time trying to work out what indicated ""as soon as"", to get a perfect translation, but I ran out of time, and I was quite sure that (A) was correct.

It turns out that it normally should be (a very slight variation is possible). So for me, this immediately discounts (A) as being the correct answer, but I still need to make sure that I totally understand the question at hand by confirming the definition of some words.

I looked up the brachial and radial pulses. Translation: the patient's pulse is weaker in his wrist and above the elbow crease in his left arm (but is normal in his right arm).

Clearly, his BP isn't going to be the same in both arms, then.

A bruit is a sound that resembles a heart murmur, and is heard over partially blocked blood vessels. Since it was heard over the area where his left subclavian artery would be (I checked), this indicates his subclavian artery is partially blocked. So, a stent will obviously be of help, as suggested in (B).

The AI's response mentioned Subclavian Steal Syndrome (SSS). I looked it up.

SSS:
- Affects the left side much more commonly than the right
- Occurs when the subclavian artery is blocked, causing reversed blood flow – which would explain the reduced left arm pulse and the arm feeling tired
o	Smoking is a risk factor – patient is a smoker
o	Symptoms include vertigo, dizziness, a difference in pulses between arms, and subclavian bruit – all of which the patient has
o	Another symptom is decreased BP in the affected arm – so (A) is even less likely to be true
o	And a treatment option for SSS is stenting of the subclavian artery, as suggested by (B).

If the patient does indeed have SSS, then (B) would certainly be true, and not (A). 

But even if SSS is a misdiagnosis on the AI's part, the evidence apart from this also seems to confirm that the correct answer can only be (B). I set my probability at 0/100 to reflect this.",B,

I then looked up the US law definition of a co-conspirator statement. It's clear now that both (A) and (B) pertain to the late husband's statement, and not the wife's testimony. 

Regarding a co-conspirator statement, it seems that this 

""must be a statement by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.""

But to my understanding, this statement wasn't made during the course of and in furtherance of the conspiracy. The conspiracy had already ended (the fire had consumed the yacht), and when he made his statement, he wasn't asking his wife to continue the conspiracy on his behalf.

I read on:

""To admit a co-conspirator’s statement under this rule, the following criteria must be met:

[1] Existence of a Conspiracy
o	The court must find that there was a conspiracy involving the declarant and the party against whom the statement is offered. This does not mean that the conspiracy must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt, but there must be sufficient evidence to demonstrate its existence.

[2] Statement Made During the Course of the Conspiracy
o	The statement must have been made while the conspiracy was ongoing. Statements made after the conspiracy has ended may not be admissible under this rule.

[3] Statement Made in Furtherance of the Conspiracy
o	The statement must be made to help achieve the goals of the conspiracy. Casual remarks about the conspiracy may not qualify.""

These criteria are unlikely to be met, because (these are my thoughts):

[1] As the AI pointed out, it's not clear from the question that there is proof of the conspiracy alleged to have been committed.

[2] The conspiracy had ended when the statement was made (according to the question, it was made the day after the incident).

[3] The statement could not have been made to help further the goals of the conspiracy, because a) the wife wasn't being asked to further the conspiracy, and b) the statement was made ""while in the presence of a nurse attending to him"". 

By this point, I was 100% sure that (A) was the correct answer. I decided to do some further research just to confirm my findings. The LII website seemed to confirm two of the points, and a US govt website confirmed all three of them:

""the co-conspirator's exception allows a conspirator hearsay rule and the sixth amendment right to or acts performed in furtherance of a conspiracy and during its pendency, provided there exists independent proof to establish the conspiracy.""

I tried searching on ""verbal contract death US law"", as I assumed this would be treated as a verbal contract. Most of the results were about wills, but as this contract wasn't conditional on death, these results aren't relevant.

I then researched general validity of verbal contracts under US law. My thinking is that this is a verbal contract, and the student had accepted the terms and carried out his consideration by not marrying. The letter from the father to the landlord, and the payment of the tuition fees, do also show that the father had agreed to provide financial assistance to his son, although they don't prove that he had promised the $200 monthly allowance. The payment of tuition fees could be considered the father fulfilling consideration on his part, however, making the contract valid.

The LII page on verbal contracts states that they are valid, unless they fail under UCC (which won't apply in this case as it's not a commercial transaction), or the statutes of fraud in each state. A state isn't mentioned in the question, so I assume anything at state level doesn't apply. Therefore, I assume this verbal contract is valid.

I did note that the LII page used the term ""verbal agreement"", so I tried to look up the difference between a verbal agreement and verbal contract under US law, but all the results generated just discussed verbal contracts.

I then decided to look up contract validity upon death, since if this is a valid contract, it should follow the usual rules.

According to LexisNexis: 

“The general rule is that the death of one of the parties to a contract does not discharge the contract. Where the contract is of a personal nature then, unless there has been a breach of the contract prior to the death, the general rule does not apply.”

I wasn't sure how to read this. Generally, the contract is still valid upon death. Unless it's a personal contract (which I assume this is). Unless the personal contract has been breached prior to death – it hasn't, unless we count the fact that the father didn't transfer money on the 25th of January when he didn't hear from the landlord. So if we apply the double-negative, a breach would make the personal contract valid again upon death...? This didn't make sense.

I then read on:

“The second thing that you should understand is that in most instances there is a presumption in the law that a contract will survive the death of the person obligated by the contract.”

So it seems more likely than not that the father (or his estate) would still be bound by the (verbal) contract.

With time almost up, I re-read the question and possible answers, as well as the AI's reasoning. 

The reasoning in (A) for the son being unsuccessful would hinge on the fact that the contract was not in writing and signed by the father. Although I haven't proven that this would count as a verbal contract and therefore be valid, if it is a verbal contract, then there's no need for it to be in writing. 

I chose (B) as my final answer because, according to my research, it seemed that if the student were to be unsuccessful, it would be due to his father's death making the contract invalid, rather than it not being in writing. However, this was difficult to research and I'm not confident that this is correct, so I set my probability at 45/55.",B,

From what I read, I'm not even sure that a court record counts as hearsay (this backs up the AI's first point):

“for verbal or nonverbal conduct to fall within the definition of the hearsay rule as defined under the federal rules of evidence, it must be either an expressly assertive written or spoken utterance, or nonverbal conduct expressly intended to be an assertion.”

I searched directly on whether court records are considered hearsay. Prior court decisions fall under the ""matter of record"" exception, and may be admitted as evidence.

""The third exception to the hearsay rule is the ""matter of record"" exception. This exception allows for official government records, private business records, prior court decisions or documents, and prior testimony of an unavailable witness to be admitted as evidence.""

I feel very confident already that (B) is correct. The woman had already pled guilty in court to the charge of driving while intoxicated in relation to the accident in question. She was fined, which shows that the judge agreed she was guilty. And this is an authenticated court record of her conviction. I can't see any reason as to why it wouldn't be accepted as evidence of her state of intoxication at the time of the incident.

I then searched on hearsay in a civil court to see whether this made a difference, but the application of the rule appears to be the same.

I went back to one of the LII pages on hearsay, and read this exception to Rule 803 Exceptions to the Rule Against Hearsay: 

""(22) Judgment of a Previous Conviction. Evidence of a final judgment of conviction if:

o	(A) the judgment was entered after a trial or guilty plea, but not a nolo contendere plea;

o	(B) the conviction was for a crime punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than a year;

o	(C) the evidence is admitted to prove any fact essential to the judgment; and

o	(D) when offered by the prosecutor in a criminal case for a purpose other than impeachment, the judgment was against the defendant.""

The verified record of the prior court judgement meets all of these criteria. The woman pled guilty, the crime was punishable by up to 2 years imprisonment (although she didn't get that, the evidence is relevant and essential to the judgement, and the judgement was against the current defendant.

I'm now 100% certain that (B) is correct. I still have research time, so I quickly look up what else might make evidence inadmissible, but then realise that the wording in (A) gives hearsay as the reason for its inadmission, so any other reasoning would be irrelevant.

But, I'm already aware (and the AI already concurred) that:

- There’s a letter where the uncle offers consideration and the timeline for the transfer
- The nephew responded with his agreement in writing
- And the owner had agreed to the lease transfer

I don't really feel I need to research this, to be honest.

The LII webpage states that a contract needs the following:

o	Offer and acceptance (yes, we have both in writing)
o	Consideration (yes – the shop and the $150k)
o	Capacity (yes  – there's no mention of uncle being not of sound mind, and this isn’t part of either answer anyway)
o	Legality (yes, there's no mention of the agreement not being in accordance with the law)

Again, it seems that the pair already had a contract before the uncle instructed his lawyer to write one up.

I then looked up US contract stipulations, in case I found anything about how a contract stipulation can't be outside either party's influence. It appears that the stipulation about the owner's agreement is a type of stipulation called a proviso, which is a clause in a contract that requires that something must occur before the agreement can be valid. But in this case, the proviso of the owner agreeing to the lease transfer did happen, so that's all fine.

I looked further into provisos, and could not find anything about them being within or without the relevant parties' direct influence.

I then looked up some proviso examples, and found one on a legal website that appeared to be outside of either stakeholder's direct influence.

Then, on re-reading the possible answers, I realised that I had been looking at this the wrong way round anyway, since (B) is still a ""yes, he was successful"" answer. Still, I haven't found anything about how a proviso being outside of the parties' direct influence is a ""good"", validating thing.

I'm now certain that the answer is (A) – they had definitely already formed a contract, and the lawyer was simply drafting up documentation of this. I set my probability at 100/0 to reflect this.",A,

I found that several of the patient's symptoms match a PAD diagnosis (leg ache when walking that goes away when resting, both legs being affected at once but the pain being worse in one leg, and ulcers on the foot that don't heal).

I also found that he meets most of the listed causes of PAD: 

o	smoking – the most significant risk factor - yes
o	type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes - yes
o	high blood pressure (hypertension) - yes
o	high cholesterol - no
o	growing older – yes

I then looked up the patient's other symptoms. His pulse isn't palpable on the right foot, indicating impaired blood flow. The nocturnal toe pain didn't come up (yet), but his ankle-brachial index scores do further indicate a PAD diagnosis.

I then read that ""Angiography of the lower extremities is most often used to diagnose PAD"", which supports answer (A).

I then decided to disprove (B) by looking up indications of infected ulcers.

From the Cleveland Clinic website, drainage from the ulcer would indicate an infection, but it's mentioned that there is no pus. The description on this website of an arterial ulcer matches the description of what the patient has. An arterial ulcer is a symptom of PAD.

I then read:

""If you have an infection or experience irritation, you might see swelling and redness around the base of the ulcer. The redness often turns to a pale white or yellow color if you elevate your leg. Arterial ulcers are typically very painful, especially at night.""

So it's not infected from the description, but this being an arterial ulcer would explain the night-time pain in his toe.

While antibiotics is listed as a possible treatment option, there is no indication that the ulcer is infected. And in any case, from what I've found, antibiotic treatment would simply be treating a symptom while ignoring the cause – as the AI also stated.

I am now 100% sure that (A) is the correct answer.",A,

""Ma"" does indeed mean what/who/how/why – the dictionary definition states that here, we fill in the appropriate sumti blank. So, it could mean ""what"" or ""who"" according to the context of the rest of the sentence.

""Lo fagri"" does translate as ""the fire"".

""Cfari"" means starts/commences/begins to occur/initiate.

""Cfagau"" means a ""person/agent"" ""initiates/begins/starts/causes the beginning of"" – this is indeed a compound word, as the AI suggests.

I already believe I can take the AI at its word, but I decided to look up how sumti questions work with ""ma"", to further prove that the AI is correct.

According to the Lojban grammar webpage I visited, ""ma"" can indeed be used to indicate ""what"" or ""who"" (etc) depending on sumti (context/subject). 

I decided to parse out each sentence and translate, according to what I had found in the dictionary and grammar webpage:

ma | cfagau | lo fagri 
what | person started | the fire?

ma | cfari | lo fagri 
what | started | the fire?

It's clear that (A) is the correct answer. I set my probability at 100/0 and concluded my research early.

It immediately became clear that what the AI stated was correct:

""Rule 404. Character Evidence; Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts

-	(b) Other Crimes, Wrongs, or Acts.
-	(1) Prohibited Uses. Evidence of any other crime, wrong, or act is not admissible to prove a person’s character in order to show that on a particular occasion the person acted in accordance with the character.
-	(2) Permitted Uses. This evidence may be admissible for another purpose, such as proving motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, absence of mistake, or lack of accident.""

So, it's true that evidence of a previous crime would not be admissible in order to prove a person's character, or to show that they had likely acted within that character. This is the reasoning given in (A) – ""Yes, to demonstrate the defendant's inclination to engage in such criminal activity."" According to Rule 404, this would not be permitted, as to demonstrate their inclination to commit such a crime, we'd need to establish that it is in their character to do so.

It is also true that evidence of other crimes is permissible in order to prove ""absence of mistake"". I then decided to look up ""absence of mistake"" within US law, to see whether the accountant's defence would fall under this description.

I found another LII page discussing the MIMIC rule (relating to the previously mentioned Rule 404). It provided the same information, but I followed a hyperlink through to the US legal definition of a ""mistake"". 

""In criminal law, a mistake can serve as a defense that claims either a misconception of the law or a mistake of some fact.""

Following the hyperlink through to the definition of ""mistake of fact"", I found that the accountant's defence would indeed fall under this category:

""A mistake of fact is a mistake about a material factual element or mistaken belief other than a mistake of law."" 

– yes, the defence of ""confusion over the payment date"" would meet this definition.

""The Model Penal Code §2.04 provides that “ignorance or mistake as to a matter of fact or law is a defense if: the ignorance or mistake negatives the purpose, knowledge, belief, recklessness or negligence required to establish a material element of the offense; or the law provides that the state of mind established by such ignorance or mistake constitutes a defense.”""

– yes, using this mistake of fact as a defence would negate the recklessness/purpose required to commit the alleged fraud.

At this point I am certain that (B) is correct, since it has been proven as possible, and (A) has been disproven.

What I read wasn't helpful (yet), so I decided to research the patient's vital readings. All of his readings were normal, apart from an elevated blood pressure.

I then looked up his swollen leg symptoms/description. The initial NHS results were too generic, so I looked up DVT, as this is what the AI suggested the patient may have.

According to the symptoms listed by the NHS, he matches the description of having single-limb swelling with warm skin. He also has the risk factor of having cancer, and the NHS states that if DVT is suspected, the patient will be referred for a diagnostic ultrasound scan. When I looked up ""venous duplex scan"" earlier, I learned that it was a type of ultrasound scan.

I then looked into DVT diagnostics and venous duplex, and confirmed that it is indeed the most likely diagnostic test used for suspected DVT.

I then looked up the other suggested answer, lower extremity CT angiogram.

I quickly learned that this is used for diagnosing PAD. From what I remember of my research for the earlier question on PAD, the symptoms that this patient has don't match. However, I looked up PAD symptoms to confirm this. It appears that if the patient had PAD, his legs would more likely feel cool to the touch, there wouldn't necessarily be swelling, there'd be other, more notable symptoms, and he would have a weak or absent pulse in his leg. According to the question, he has pulses on both sides of his leg.

I also then did some more reading, and decided to confirm that (as I suspect) PAD symptoms are slower onset (yes), and DVT symptoms are faster onset, as this patient has experienced (also yes).

At this point, I'm confident that I have proved (A) is true as much as possible, and I have also disproved (B) as much as possible. I set my probability at 95/5, as I did follow the AI's suggestion of DVT and didn't go down the route of trying to check every other possible diagnosis with the presented symptoms (if this is even possible!).",A,

According to the LII website:

""A witness may ""plead the Fifth"" and not answer if the witness believes answering the question may be self-incriminatory.""

I then followed a hyperlink through to the page on self-incrimination. On reading the definition, I considered whether this would apply to this witness. 

""Self-incrimination is the intentional or unintentional act of providing information that will suggest your involvement in a crime, or expose you to criminal prosecution.""

then:

""But it may extend to a witness in any proceeding if their testimony provides a reasonable possibility of incriminating oneself in future criminal proceedings, even if the testimony is made in a civil procedure.""

I think this comes down to whether the witness' alleged intoxicating drug use referred to a criminalised drug, and we don't know this. 

If it referred to marijuana use in certain states, she may have wanted to remain silent simply so that her testimony wouldn't appear unreliable, as the AI had pointed out. In this case she would not be allowed to plead the fifth, as there would be no fear of future criminal proceedings.

If she had used illegal drugs, then she would have likely been refusing to answer in order to avoid self-incrimination, which could lead to prosecution later. In this case, she would be permitted to plead the fifth.

Without knowing the type of drug (and possibly the state), I'm not sure whether it's possible to answer this one accurately!

I decided that it was more likely than not that the drug in question was illegal, given how few intoxicating drugs are legalised in the US, and then only in selected states.

I searched on, to confirm that the right to remain silent would apply to witnesses in civil trials, and that they would be permitted to selectively answer questions. I firstly found content referring to how this is applicable to criminal cases, but eventually found some text on the Greenspunlaw website that confirms that it applies to witnesses in civil cases also:

""Witnesses and defendants may be able to plead the Fifth in these situations: Criminal proceedings, Civil lawsuits...""

""Self-incriminating. In order to be considered self-incriminating, the statements sought to be compelled must be such that it may lead to criminal prosecution or lead to other evidence that will be used for this purpose. This includes information that provides links in the chain towards a possible prosecution of the individual.""

And

""… if the prosecution can make use of the answer itself or any evidence it might lead to, the witness is entitled to claim the privilege against self-incrimination.""

Assuming the witness used illegal drugs, I believe that the right to remain silent while testifying as a witness in a civil case would apply. Therefore, the correct answer would be (A).

I set my probability at 70/30 due to the uncertainty over whether the drug use would be incriminating. 

Note: And I now think I'm incorrect, as I realised that the woman would be the plaintiff, not a witness. Doh!",A,

The LII website confirmed that a dying declaration is a statement made by declarant under belief of impending death, and that while it’s hearsay, it counts as an exception to the hearsay rule, listed in Section 804(b)(2) of Federal Rules of Evidence.

I then followed the hyperlink to Section 804(b)(2):

""(2) Statement Under the Belief of Imminent Death. In a prosecution for homicide or in a civil case, a statement that the declarant, while believing the declarant’s death to be imminent, made about its cause or circumstances.""

This confirms that the dying declaration would be a hearsay exception (as the patient believed he was dying and the statement was about his cause of death), if the doctor's affidavit is admissible to provide that necessary context. 

I looked up ""affidavit"" to clarify the meaning – it's a sworn statement made out of court, where the person asserts that certain facts are true (or they are true to the best of their knowledge).

Ok, so it's been determined that the patient's statement would be admissible, but would the doctor's – which is needed to admit the original statement?

I looked up general hearsay exceptions, but nothing here jumped out.

I then looked up whether an affidavit is generally admissible in US court. I read that it generally isn't admissible at trial as it's considered hearsay, but then this was a personal injury law website, and they may have been playing this up for their own benefit. I know by now that there are plenty of exceptions to hearsay.

I then read in a post on Law StackExchange:

""An affidavit is not admissible evidence in court unless a specific exception to the hearsay rule applies.""

Not too helpful, but confirms an affidavit is treated the same as all general hearsay.

I went back to re-read the answers. (A) states that the judge can consider hearsay when determining ""preliminary issues."" I looked up preliminary issues.

""A “preliminary issue” is a discrete element of a dispute that has the potential to decisively conclude the claim...""

So, it's an element of dispute that would influence how the trial goes. This certainly seems to apply to the doctor's statement, as if it can be used to prove the patient's statement was a dying declaration, the patient's statement against the driver could be taken into account.

I then read on the LII website: 

""Rule 104: Preliminary Questions
o	(a) In General. The court must decide any preliminary question about whether a witness is qualified, a privilege exists, or evidence is admissible. In so deciding, the court is not bound by evidence rules, except those on privilege.""

If the court is not bound by evidence rules, I assume this means the judge can take hearsay into account.

Other quotations on the page (I'm not sure whether they were law or just arguments) appeared to back up the assertion that the judge can take into account hearsay and affidavits when deciding on preliminary questions. 

I then confirmed with another legal website:

""The Rules provide that preliminary questions concerning:  ... (c) admissibility of evidence, must be determined by the court outside the presence of the jury. Federal Rule of Evidence 104. The rules of evidence do not apply to such proceedings, thus hearsay is admissible.""

So it appears that the doctor’s statement would be admissible in establishing the preliminary question of the admissibility of the patient's statement, since hearsay/affidavits are admissible at this stage in proceedings. The AI is correct, although not exactly for the reasons that it stated.

I then researched into the delivery rules and responsibilities stated by the UCC and was affirmed that there is no delivery obligation without payment being presented on the day of delivery.
At this point I was confident in the correct answer being B",B,"Aside from reading through, I did not use the guidelines. "

I initially searched for brachial and radial pulses as I did not know what these were to get a quick understanding. I then researched inserting a stent in the left subclavian artery to try to ascertain when this is a needed procedure and what may cause its needs. I was able to affirm that it could be used to alleviate the prognosis given.
I then researched systolic blood pressure measurements to find out more about them and whether they do ever have an imbalance, if so, why. I furthered this research looking into imbalances in arm readings and this pointed to there being imbalances when there are heart conditions and troubles, so seemed unlikely that the answer would be A.
I then researched subclavian steal syndrome to find out what it was and whether it was indeed linked to the symptoms and discovered that it was identified with many of the given symptoms, as well as having a treatment by stent insertion.
I was quite sure of Answer B, but searched for ""bruit is heard above his left clavicle"" as I was unsure what a bruit was and how this affected the prognosis, I discovered that it could be easily linked with the symptoms that had occurred and so was likely, affirming my thoughts further towards answer B.
I finally returned to trying to discover more about imbalances with blood pressure, specifically with regards to subclavian steal syndrome and decided it was likely that there would be a difference in readings between the two arms.",B,"I did research both guidelines 1 and 2, but not specifically because of the guidelines.

I did not get a definitive answer from this but my research led me to believe that if there was this kind of usage it could be quite weak and hard to use.

I started by searching for ""antibiotics to treat ulcer on foot"" as I wished to ascertain if this is an actual treatment for this and if so, when is it used. This led to me understanding that it can be, but only when there is infection. It also pointed to the fact that when it is not healing by itself there should be further consultation. At this point I believed that it was less likely to be the correct procedure in the given case. I moved the percentage slider to 90% for question A at this point.

Whilst reading through this article I again returned to the percentage slider and moved it to 95% question A. I also carried out another search concerning pulse rates as I wished to know if the patient in the case had a low pulse rate, although from the information I believed his pulse rate to be within the normal range. 
I looked into a second article regarding Angiography to clarify, but this was more regarding the actual scanning process involved in an angiography than a description of it.

Baxter, used to estimate the amount of replacement fluid required for the first 24 hours in a burn patient so as to ensure the patient is hemodynamically stable. Circumferential full-thickness burns with resultant loss of skin elasticity can produce a tourniquet effect on limbs and trunk, which can lead to compromised distal perfusion, airway obstruction, and poor respiratory effort. PVCs rarely cause problems unless they occur again and again over a long period of time. In such cases, they can lead to a PVC-induced cardiomyopathy, or a weakening of the heart muscle from too many PVCs. This response, along with decreased cardiac output and increased vascular resistance, can lead to marked hypovolemia and hypoperfusion called “burn shock.” This can be managed with aggressive fluid resuscitation and close monitoring for adequate, but not excessive, IV fluids.",A,"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6."

The security officer falls under these exceptions since he did not participate in the civil court proceedings and therefore the plaintiff’s estates evidence is permissible because of the following:
1.	Federal Rule of Evidence 804 deals with exceptions to the hearsay rule for unavailable declarants. It provides a framework for admitting certain hearsay statements when the person who made the statement (the declarant) is unavailable to testify in court. Over here the declarant is the security personnel.
2.	Federal Rule 804(b) outlines specific exceptions to the hearsay rule for statements made by an unavailable declarant, which include former testimony thus statements made by the declarant in a previous trial or proceeding that are now offered as evidence in a different case. Due to this, law the evidence is permissible.

In a homicide or civil case, a declaration of a dying person while at the time of making the statement believed they were impending, or imminent death can be admissible in court. If the statement was made about their cause of death or circumstance, this can be an exception.

I also learned that the free fluid of urine from a damaged bladder can drain into the abdominal cavity which can cause peritoneum. This can be difficult to detect only through image studies such as x-ray. This was also conducted on the patient in the article.

A unilateral contract is a contract where by one party the offeror makes an offer or a promise in exchange for the performance of an act by the other party know as an offeree. 
In order to accept a unilateral contract, the offeree must perform the specific act but it’s not enough for the offeree to begin to perform, they must complete the required performance.
In this situation the offeror is the bank, and the offeree is the customer. The customer joined the queue while the promotional sign was up, and this indicates he has stated performing the specific act on the promotional sign. Now the customer kept track of the time and even though the promotional sign was changed later. Even though, the new sign stated the promotion was discontinued, he was still in the queue for more than 5 minutes which means he has completed the task or act that was on the promotional sign, and therefore deserves to be rewarded for that.
Now regarding the bank changing the promotional sign and discontinuing the promotion, this does not affect the customer as they have already started performing the act.
As per research regarding revoking a unilateral contract, an offeror can revoke their unilateral contact at any time before performance starts. Also, the offeror can’t revoke a unilateral contract once the offeree starts a physical performance of the contract which is what the customer did before the promotional sign was changed.

As per my research, the agreement between the father and son, can be considered a promise or in legal doctrine terms, can be referred to as promissory estoppel.
In the court of law, promissory estoppel or a promised can be enforced by law.
Since the student obliged and adhered to all the requests from his father in order for him to pay his tuition fees, accommodation and an allowance, including not getting married until he graduates, he has entered into a promise or promissory estoppel with his father.

From the statement, it can be inferred or deduced that the possible agreement between the lawyer and the client is an implied-in-fact contract.
An implied-in-fact contract is formed between two parties based on actions, behaviors, conduct or circumstances of the involved parties, rather than through written or verbal consent.
An example of such a contract is, when you walk into a hair salon and sit in a chair for a haircut. If the barber cuts your hair, thus provides you a service, you are obliged to pay him or her for the service provided even though there was no written or verbal agreement.
In the statement, the lawyer found a paper in his office with a legal question from a customer who he has completed a task for recently. Now he went ahead to provide answer or response to the question and sent it back the customer with an invoice.
Now since he acted on the request from former client, by providing legal advice in a response which he had sent to her, this definitely falls under an implied-in-fact contract. 
Therefore, the client has no choice but to pay the lawyer even though she stated that she did not go ahead to sell her yacht and therefore did not require the response.

We have to first look at the definition of admission against interest. An admission against interest is as an out-of-court statement made by a party that is against their own pecuniary, proprietary, or penal interest, and that is admissible under both an exclusion (admission by a party-opponent) and an exception (statement against interest) to the rule against hearsay. 
The general rule against hearsay prevents out of court statements being used in court because these statements may be untrustworthy. However, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule which allow for a declaration against interest under the reasoning that a person would rarely say something that would be against their interests unless it were true. 
In this case, the deceased friend, knowing he would pass away soon, confessed receiving a payment and his involvement in the crime to his wife. 
Even though the statement he made to his wife is out of court and falls under the hearsay rules, it can fall under the exceptions of hearsay under admission against interest. Therefore, the statement he made to his wife can be used in court.

This prevents the passage of milk and digestive fluids. Some of the symptoms of low birth weight, vomiting, and swelling in the upper abdomen.
This condition requires a surgery to repair it.
Diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema is a condition in newborn babies where air gets trapped in the tissues outside of tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. It occurs when the lungs do not make enough surfactant which allows the alveoli to be more flexible and prevents them from breaking.
Some of the symptoms include fast breathing, grunting and parts of the babies body tinted blue(cyanosis) due to low oxygen in the blood.

Looking at the symptoms and the condition of the newborn, they are very similar to the symptoms of diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema, there if can be deduced that the newborn may be suffering from diffuse pulmonary interstitial edema

A varicocele is an enlargement of the veins inside the scrotum due to malfunctioning of valves within the veins in the scrotum. Varicoceles can occur on either the left or the right side of the scrotum, however they most commonly occur on the left side because of the function of the veins on the left side to keep blood flowing through to the heart.
A varicocele on the right side is not a serious medical condition, however it is an indication of an abnormality. Right side varicoceles may indicate a blockage in the abdomen resulting from factors such as blood clots, tumors, or problems with internal organs. In some cases, it may indicate the of adrenocortical carcinoma. Adrenocortical carcinoma are cancerous tumors that affect the adrenal glands.
A doctor may request further abdominal tests including a CT scan to check abdominal masses or tumors.

From my research, children are allowed to testify in criminal or civil proceedings if they meet certain criteria such as their capacity to observe, sufficient intelligence, adequate memory, their ability to communicate, an awareness of the difference between truth and falsehood, and an appreciation of the obligation to tell the truth.
Most articles I came across, stated that usually children under the ages of 10, 12, 14 are presumptively incompetent unless determined otherwise. For children below these ages, a voir dire examination is usually held to determine whether a child is competent, and the trial judge has substantial discretion regarding the conduct of this examination.
In another article Criminal Justice Quarterly Volume: 7 Issue: 1 Dated: (SPRING/SUMMER 1979) Pages: 17-27, states that child witnesses under the age of 14 should be admitted only if they are adjudged by the trial court to possess the requisite mental capacity and moral responsibility.

From the statement in question 19, the young toddler is of the age of 4 years and was seriously injured. From the articles, since this child is under 14 years, the presiding judge will have to consider some criteria and determine the competency and mental capacity before the toddler can provide a testimony on this trial.

In conclusion, choice B was my best option after doing my research.

From my research, the car buyer is likely to win, if they decide to sue the car dealer. The car dealer can be charged with either fraudulent concealment or fraudulent misrepresentation.
Fraudulent concealment is the purposeful act of concealing or failing to disclose facts relevant to a transaction to defraud or mislead another party. This can happen in a contract, where one person doesn't tell the other person something they should know. In proving fraudulent concealment, the person who was misled must show that the fact was important, that the other person knew about it, that they meant to hide it, and that the person who was misled suffered because of it.
Fraudulent misrepresentation can be defined as any type of false statement or lie that is used to trick an individual into an agreement. The misrepresentation may occur in many ways, including written words, spoken words, gestures motion like a nod.
For example, if an automobile dealer lies regarding the accident history of a used vehicle in order to get an individual to sign a purchase contract, then it may be considered fraudulent misrepresentation. 
From the definitions of fraudulent misrepresentation and concealment, it is evident that the car buyer has a case and could win if the decide to sue the car dealer as long as they can prove the all the elements of fraudulent misrepresentation.

The Fifth amendment states that no person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases where they shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. 
The Fifth Amendment grants defendants several kinds of rights, particularly the right to resist incriminating oneself. Witnesses can plead the fifth in either civil or criminal proceedings to assert the privilege against self-incrimination.
In civil proceedings, a defendant may be able to invoke the fifth amendment and refuse to answer questions during depositions or trial if they believe that testimony can incriminate them.

First, I looked at the definition of Undue influence which refers to a situation where one person takes advantage of their position of power or trust to manipulate or pressure another person into making a decision that they would not have otherwise made. It usually involves exerting an unfair amount of control over someone, undermining their ability to make an independent and voluntary choice.
In my research, I found that undue influence can arise in various contexts, such as contracts, wills, and transactions.

Since there is a high degree of trust and reliance in certain relationships such as between parent and a child, or a solicitor and a client, if one of the partners in such a relationship unduly influences the other, there is a high chance of undue influence.
However, inadequate consideration refers to a situation where the value of the consideration exchanged in a contract is not fair or reasonable under the circumstances of the agreement. 

In order to prove undue influence, a party must show that the other party to the contract is a person with weaknesses which makes him or her likely to be affected by such persuasion, and that the party exercising the persuasion is someone in a special relationship with the victim that makes the victim especially susceptible to such persuasion.
In this question, the daughter has a special relationship with her mother and she even threaten her mother with ceasing to visit her if she did not sign the contract willing the house to her at a value of $100,000.
It is very clear that, due to the relationship of the mother and daughter and the fact that the daughter forced her mother into a contract against her will, this contract will therefore be invalid under Undue influence.
This is the reason why I chose A, as my final answer.

From the agreement signed between the plumbing supply company and the property manager the location of delivery and terms of payment were not outlined in it. 
However, the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) law applies to this kind of agreement between merchant or a seller and a buyer.
Under UCC law article 2-308. Absence of specified place for delivery, it states that unless otherwise agreed:
(a) the place for delivery of goods is the seller's place of business or if he has none his residence;
(b) in a contract for sale of identified goods which to the knowledge of the parties at the time of contracting are in some other place, that place is the place for their delivery; and
(c) documents of title may be delivered through customary banking channels.

Also, under UCC law article 2-310. Open Time for Payment or Running of Credit; Authority to Ship Under Reservation, it states that unless otherwise agreed:
(a) payment is due at the time and place at which the buyer is to receive the goods even though the place of shipment is the place of delivery; and
(b) if the seller is authorized to send the goods he may ship them under reservation, and may tender the documents of title, but the buyer may inspect the goods after their arrival before payment is due unless such inspection is inconsistent with the terms of the contract (Section 2-513).

First, let’s look at the definition of hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of whatever it asserts, which is then offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter. In general, hearsay evidence is not admissible in court.
However, hearsay maybe admissible in court if an exception applies.
There are many exceptions to the hearsay rule, however, I would like to focus on the catchall rule.
The catchall exception to the rule against hearsay provides that, evidence of a hearsay statement not included in one of the other exceptions may nevertheless be admissible if it meets the following conditions:
•	It has sound guarantees of trustworthiness.
•	It helps prove a material fact.
•	It is more probative than other equivalent and reasonably obtainable evidence.
•	Its admission would forward the cause of justice.
 
Now considering going back to the statement, it can be observed that the testimony of the officer falls under hearsay rule, since he was informed about the hit-and-run incident by an anonymous driver. The statement from the anonymous driver to the officer is definitely hearsay.
Now, testimony of the officer even though is a hearsay, it may be admissible in court since it considered as an exception because it qualifies under the catchall exception of the rule of hearsay. This is because it has a probative value and can be prejudice against the defendant as it puts him as the driver of the hit-and-run car.

First I researched what was acute otitis media. Acute otitis media is also known as an ear infection of the middle-ear, is an infection that occurs in the middle ear, which is located in the air-filled space behind the eardrum that contains the tiny vibrating bones of the ear. This infection is more common in children than in adults. 
Treatment is usually by monitoring or with antibiotics. Acute otitis media, can also but very rarely develop into mastoiditis, which is bacterial infection in your mastoid — the big bone behind your ear.
Some of the symptoms of mastoiditis in children are fever, ear pain, and swelling redness and tender mass behind the ear.
The child was previously given an antibiotic amoxicillin to treat acute otitis media, which initially subsided. It was later observed that the child had a high temperature, which is a fever and an earache behind the ear, which are similar to the symptoms of the acute otitis media developing into a mastoiditis.
The most appropriate step to diagnose and manage this condition in the child is through a CT scan which provides detailed images of inside of the child skull.

First, let us look at the definition of hearsay. Hearsay is an out-of-court statement offered to prove the truth of whatever it asserts, which is then offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter. The problem with hearsay is that when the person being quoted is not present, it becomes impossible to establish credibility. As a result, hearsay evidence is generally not admissible in court. 
However, there are exceptions to the hearsay rule one of which is the declaration against interest. Declaration against interest is a statement made by a declarant who is unavailable that is against the declarant’s pecuniary, proprietary, or penal interest when it was made.
Considering the definition of hearsay and its exceptions, it can be observed that any statement made by the co-passenger falls under hearsay and does not fall under any exceptions. Any statement the co-passenger makes may fall under credibility since we do not know if she is telling the truth or not but is not admissible in court.

In this translation, it seems like it is used by a person to compare 2 items using a property / quantity.
In the sentence, we are not comparing 2 items instead it says that one person loves tea more than another person.
Looking at the translation of ""nelmau"" in lojban to English, there was no direct translation or it did not have a meaning in English. However, it is made of two words which ""nelci"" and ""zmadu"". The word ""nelci"" translates to ""x1 is fond of/likes/has a taste for x1(an object/state)"" and ""zmadu"" translates to "" x1 exceeds/is more than x2 in property/quantity x3 by amount/excess x4"". The word ""nelmau"" better describes how fond Mark is of tea than Jane, rather than the use of the word ""zmanei"" which only draws comparison of 2 items based on a property.

Most contracts can either be written or oral and will still be legally enforceable. Some important elements that make a contract legally binding or valid are:
•	Offer– One party promising to do something, or conversely, promising to refrain from doing a particular action which could be in the form of a written contract.
•	Acceptance– The unambiguous nature by which an agreement is solidified. This may be done verbally, or through performance or deed.
•	Awareness– Both parties acknowledge the contract agreement exists.
•	Consideration– When something of value is offered in exchange for the above-stated action or inaction; the value that induces the parties to enter into the contract.
•	Capacity– Individuals must have the ability to reasonably have a mutual understanding of what entering a contract agreement means; individuals compromised by, for example, alcohol, may be found to lack capacity with respect to contract law.
•	Legality– Valid contracts must fall in line with existing laws.

Generally, it is advisable to have your contract in writing to ensure both parties understand their obligations. It is easier to enforce a written contract than a verbal contract. Some examples of contracts required to be in writing include:
•	Mortgage agreements
•	Lease agreements
•	Online purchases
•	Sign-up agreements
•	Insurance
•	Promissory notes

From the statement, it is clearly observed that the uncle wrote to his nephew offering him the antique store for a price, for which the nephew wrote him back in acceptance of the offer. It can also be observed that verbally the uncle confirmed that the owner of the building agreed to the lease transfer which was one of the conditions for the Uncle selling the store to his nephew.
Even though the Uncle intended to instruct his lawyer to create a written document, there has already been an exchange of an agreement in writing which was accepted by both parties, which is a binding contract.
Therefore, the nephew can sue his Uncle for a breach of contract.

First, considering the patient’s medical history of being hypertensive, hyperlipidemic, diabetic, and a smoking history, along with his non-healing ulcer on his toe, it can be drawn that he is suffering from peripheral artery disease (PAD).
Peripheral artery disease is a condition whereby narrowed arteries reduce blood flow to the arms or legs. In PAD of the legs, usually the legs do not receive enough blood flow, which can cause pain in the leg when walking.
Some of the symptoms of PAD are:
•	Numbness or weakness in the legs.
•	 Painful cramping in either one or both the hips, thighs, or calf muscles after walking or climbing stairs.
•	Ulcers or open sores on the toes or legs that won’t heal.
From the sentence, it can be observed that the patient showed signs of these symptoms and clearly confirms he has PAD.
From the sentence it can also be noted that an ankle-brachial index test was carried out on the patient. This is a simple and quick test to check for PAD.
From his results, the index for both his legs were less than 0.90, which indicates or confirms PAD.
The best next step of management for this condition and from the observation of symptoms is to carry out a non-invasive test called angiography to view the arteries in the legs.
I did not choose B, because of his severe symptoms and this is a non-healing ulcer so initiating oral antibiotics would not be the best next step.
Therefore, from my research above, I decided to go with choice A as my final answer.

First, let’s look at what are the Miranda rights or Miranda warning. Miranda rights or warnings refers to the warnings or rights a police officer is required to give to a detainee based on constitutional requirements. These rights are usually read or given to a detainee when they are in police custody or before interrogation about an alleged crime.
Miranda rights include the following:
•	You have the right to remain silent.
•	Anything you say can and will be used against you in court of law.
•	You have the right to an attorney.
•	If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you.
Miranda rights guarantees your Fifth Amendment right under the US constitution which protects a person from being compelled to be a witness against yourself (Self-incrimination). This reduces the likelihood that a criminal suspect ultimately gives a coerced confession.

From the passage, a Police officer started to recite the Miranda rights to both accusers when Accuser A spoke up to confession. At the point, Accuser A had revoked their protection under the Fifth Amendment while Accuser B was still protected as he was still silent after the Miranda rights were being recited.

Now, let’s look at the definition of a confession. A confession is an out-of-court statement made by a suspect in which he or she voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently acknowledges that he or she committed or participated in the commission of a crime. 
It should also be noted that, any confession given while a person is under arrest or in custody of law enforcement will not be admissible in court.
Looking at the definition of a confession, it clear that it is a hearsay statement which under the hearsay rule is prohibited from being admitted as evidence in court of law.

Considering all the statements above from my research and details from the passage, Accused B not responding or objecting to the accusatory statement of Accused A is impermissible as evidence since under the Miranda rights Accused B has the right to remain silent and has no duty or obligation not respond to any accusations.
This is why I chose B as my final answer.

From my research, I first checked what was the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS). This is a system or score using to measure how conscious a patient is. This is used as a neurological exam and used in injury-related conditions like concussions and traumatic brain injuries.
The scores of GCS can be interpreted as follows, a score of 15 means you are fully awake and a score of 8 or less means you’re in a coma. 
Since the patient had a GCS score of 10, means he moderate traumatic brain injury. 
A Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) scan is an ultrasonic scan which is used to detect free intra-abdominal or pericardial fluid in a trauma patient.
The FAST scan on the patient did not provide any clear diagnosis, therefore further examination had to be carried out on the patient.
From a pelvic radiography, it was however observed that there was a fracture in both ischial rami or the pelvic bones. Pelvic fractures may cause shock, extensive internal bleeding, and damage to internal organs. 
A non-invasive exam which be used to evaluate patients with blunt trauma is the CT scan. CT scans have a high sensitivity and specificity in blunt abdominal injury helping to identify any free fluid or damage to organs in the abdomen.
These the abdominal CT scan is non-invasive procedure which can provide results of any abdominal injuries as compared to the diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) which is invasive.

First, let us look at the definition of a contract. A contract is an agreement between two parties, that creates an obligation to perform (or not perform) a particular duty that are enforceable by law. The elements required for an agreement to be a legally enforceable contract are:
1.	An Offer.
2.	An Acceptance.
3.	Mutual Consideration.
4.	Legal Parties.
5.	Legal Purpose.
Contracts are also promises that the law will enforce. Contracts arise when a duty comes into existence, because of a promise made by one of the parties. 
If a promise is breached, the law provides remedies to the harmed party, often in the form of monetary damages, or in limited circumstances, in the form of specific performance of the promise made.

From the passage, the executive received a formal signed decree from the corporation's board of directors which stated that whenever the executive chooses to retire, the corporation would provide him a monthly pension of $2,000 for the rest of his life. This can be considered as a contract, as the board of directors have promised to perform a duty which has been formally written and signed, therefore it is enforceable by law.

With this promise on the table, the executive was convinced to go on retirement and purchase the vehicle which he planned to use for his travels. In the terms of the signed formal decree, it did not mention any changes to the lifetime pension to the executive in case of any unforeseeable changes in circumstances.
As the company promised the executive a lifetime monthly pension of $2,000, any cessation to this can be considered as a breach in contract.

Based on the above-mentioned points, the executive could prevail if he files a lawsuit against the corporation for breach of contract.
This is why I chose A as my final answer.

First, I used some of the guidelines from AI, by researched what is subclavian steal syndrome and what are its typical symptoms.
Subclavian steal syndrome(SSS) can be described as a condition where an artery takes or “steals” blood to your arm instead of sending it to your brain. This is due to the narrowing or blockage in your subclavian artery, usually the left one which sends blood to your arm on that side.
Some of the risk factors of the subclavian steal syndrome include:
•	Family history of vascular diseases
•	Smoking
•	Diabetes 
•	Hypertension.
Some of the symptoms of the SSS are more likely to occur when you feel pain in your arm after an exercise or when you turn your head suddenly to the side.
Other symptoms include:
•	Vertigo.
•	Visual loss or blurry vision.
•	Dizziness.
•	Tingling, numbness, pain, or tiredness in your arm.
Now if we go back to the passage, you will notice that the patient felt fatigue in his left arm after performing his job as a woodworker. He also complained of dizziness and vertigo, which are all clear symptoms of someone affected by subclavian steal syndrome.
Even with this, we cannot conclude that the patient is suffering from SSS without some further investigation.
One exam used by healthcare providers to diagnose SSS is by measure the blood pressure of both your arms. If the blood pressure for both arms is not the same, with one arm having a pressure difference of about 15 mmHg more than the other arm, then this indicates the patient is highly having Subclavian artery syndrome.
During the examination of the pulses of the arms it was noticed that the left side had a relatively reduced brachial and radial pulse as compared to the right arm. 
This therefore confirms that a subclavian steal syndrome could be occurring on the left arm of the woodworker and that is why his left arm gets fatigued.
With the above analysis, I conclude that, my final right answer for this question is B.

From the passage, the respondent wishes to attack the credibility of the expert witness introduced by the claimant to provide evidence regarding the case.
However, this expert witness has a history of submitting false testimony in a trial before.
Now, let us look at Federal Rule 608 (b) - Evidence of character and conduct of witness which states that Specific Instances of Conduct of a witness except for a criminal conviction under Rule 609, extrinsic evidence is not admissible to prove specific instances of a witness’s conduct in order to attack or support the witness’s character for truthfulness. They may, however, in the discretion of the court, if probative of truthfulness or untruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness.

The previous false testimony provided by the expert witness is a specific instance that is probative of his character of truthfulness. Therefore, from Federal Rule 608 (b), the court may allow this evidence to be inquired into if they are probative fo the character for truthfulness or untruthfulness of the expert witness.

First, let’s look at what is a quitclaim deed. A quitclaim deed releases a person’s interest in a property without stating the nature of the person’s interest or rights, and with no warranties of that person’s interest or rights in the property. 
A quitclaim deed makes no assurance that the grantor actually has an ownership interest in a property; it merely states that if the grantor does, they release those ownership rights. As a result, when accepting a quitclaim deed, the buyer of a property accepts the risk that the grantor of the deed may not have a valid ownership interest in the property.

In the passage, Zoey and Xavier signed a written agreement where Xavier would pay Zoey an amount of money in exchange for Zoey to provide Xavier with a quitclaim deed ensuring the apple orchard is transferred to Xavier without any warranties. 
From the court litigation regarding the rightful claim of the apple orchard between Zoey and Zane, the court ruled in favor of Zane being the rightful owner.

Xavier who already had a quitclaim deed with Zoey was unaware of the court ruling in favor of Zane being the rightful owner of the orchard.
Since the quitclaim does not make any assurance that the grantor has ownership interest in the property, Zoey can’t use this to take legal action against Xavier for withholding subsequent payments.

However, looking at the fact that after the signed written agreement, between Xavier and Zoey, Xavier made a first payment to Zoey. This can be seen as acceptance to the agreement as he made the payment which is accepted by Zoey.
Therefore, Xavier withholding the rest of the payment, could be considered as a breach in contract.

From the passage, the original agreement between the property owner and the construction company was a signed written agreement.
We are not told if there was a no-oral-modification clause in the signed agreement which prohibits the modification of the contract verbally.

Now, it is worth noting that all states in the U.S have a business law, generally know as a statute of frauds, which is a common law that requires certain types of contracts to be in writing to be legally enforceable agreement. The types of contracts that must be in writing are:
•	Contracts in consideration of marriage (including prenuptial agreements).
•	Contracts that cannot be completed within one year.
•	Real estate contracts (the sale of land, etc.).
•	Executor/estate.
•	Sale of goods that are $500 or more (which may be covered under the Uniform Commercial Code).
•	Surety (an agreement to pay someone's debts which often involves a promisor and a guarantor).
Construction contracts are not expressly covered by statute of frauds however contract law treats construction contracts as falling within the terms and some categories in the statute of frauds.
From the explanations above and from the passage, even though we do not know if there was a no-oral-modification clause in the signed agreement, we can consider that the signed agreement falls within the statute of fraud. Therefore, the construction company violated the contractual obligation of the signed contract with the property owner, even though there was an oral modification.

I started off by researching some of the questions the AI used as a guideline. I searched for what is a small bowel obstruction (SBO). Small Bowel Obstruction is a partial or complete blockage of your small intestines. 
SBO is usually caused by scar tissue (abdominal adhesions) from previous surgeries, hernia or cancerous tumors. 
Some common symptoms of small bowl obstruction are:
•	Abdominal pain or cramping.
•	Nausea and vomiting of dark green or yellow bile.
•	Bloating.
•	If fluid and air cannot advance beyond the obstruction, patients can no longer pass gas or have a bowel movement (obstipation) or severe constipation.

The management and treatment of patients with SBO is urgent fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids and electrolytes to treat dehydration as patients are often fluid deplete. 
Next is for the patient to be made nil-by-mouth, thus, not to eat or drink anything through the mouth and to have a nasogastric tube passed through the nostrils to the stomach to decompress or suction out fluids from the stomach.

From the passage looking at the symptoms of the patient such as abdominal pain, vomiting bile which does not contain blood, abdominal X-ray showing dilated bowel loops with multiple air-fluid levels, it is evident that his has SBO.
Since the ED provided fluid resuscitation which is one of the steps to managing this condition, the next appropriate step is to perform a nasogastric tube decompression to suction out fluid and gases from the stomach.
This is why I chose B as my final answer.

Now, let us look at what is a commission and if there are any state or federal laws governing this. A sales commission is an amount of money paid to a salesperson or representative based on the number of sales made in a pay period.
There are no federal or state laws requiring commissions. There are also no federal laws regarding the payment of commissions following termination of employment.
Some states expressly prohibit employers from withholding commissions that were earned before the termination of employment. 
However, in this passage we are not told which state the salesman lives in, so we are unable to use state laws in his defense.
An employment contract determines the compensation plan between the salesperson and the employer. The employment contract describes employee compensation, the amount and timing of commission payments.
If a case comes down to litigation and there are no state laws governing the sales commission, then the terms of commission stated in employment contract or agreement is used.

From the passage, it is explicitly stated that in order to qualify for a commission from the sale of a supercomputer, the salesperson must be an active employee of the company at the time the invoice is issued to the client.
The salesman’s employment was terminated on March 15, while the manufacturer finally billed the client of the supercomputer on March 31. As at the time the client was billed, the salesman was no more an employee of the manufacturing company and therefore as per the terms of his contract will not be paid the commission on the sale of the supercomputer.
For this reason, I chose B as my final answer.

One common way for the bladder dome to be injured I found also matched with this catch, having a full bladder and a high speed collision from wearing a seatbelt. 
Since the medical staff noticed a strong odor of alcohol, and the strong link between drinking excessive alcohol and the need to frequently urinate, there was a strong chance he had a full bladder at the time of collision. To further my reasoning, the abdomen being distended and having generalized mild tenderness is also a common symptom. The CT scan also showing a significant amount of free fluid in the peritoneum, was also likely to be related to the bladder. 

On the other hand, there being no blood present at the urethral meatus, would give further evidence to the injury being an issue of the bladder dome rather than the Urethra.

I found that it would be used in situations where there was an absence of information in a contract, such as delivery location and payment terms.

I then wanted to look at the absence of payment terms.

This led me to believe that option A was wrong about the implied payment terms, and option B was accurate, as unless the property manager was willing to pay at the time of delivery at the plumbing supply corporation's headquarters (because of the absence of specified place for delivery), the plumbing supply corporation would have no obligation to deliver the goods.

I am not completely confident in my answer for a few reasons. The first being that I read in the case ""Fitzpatrick v. United States, 178 U.S. 304, (1900)"", a murder defendant testified that he was at two bars and then his cabin the night of the crime. The trial court held that having waived his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, the defendant was subject to cross examination about what he was wearing that night, his connections to a co-defendant, the co-defendant's clothes, and who else was at the cabin with him. The Supreme Court affirmed the conviction, holding that if a defendant voluntary makes a statement about the crime at trial, the prosecution may cross-examine him with as much latitude as it would have with any other witness. This suggested that the information voluntarily offered, would be subject to cross-examination without the right to plead the 5th. 

However, on the other hand, this was a criminal case and already a defendant, and the situation is slightly different. I also read that ""The Fifth Amendment also protects criminal defendants from having to testify if they may incriminate themselves through the testimony. A witness may ""plead the Fifth"" and not answer if the witness believes answering the question may be self-incriminatory."".

Since we assumed that the termination of the salesman's employment by the manufacturer was not unjust, I did not look into whether he would have a case based on wrongful termination.

A passenger in the car replies “Oh yeah, he’s had twelve beers in the last hour.” Prosecutors cannot have the officer testify at trial about the passenger’s statement in order to prove that the driver had been drinking. That said, a clever prosecutor might be able to fit that statement into a hearsay exception."". 

On the other hand, and my reasoning for being more confident in my answer, is I could not find any evidence or reasoning for why option B (Not admissible, due to the fact it could potentially steer the court's attention towards nonessential, irrelevant topics) would be accurate. The comment would be relevant to the topic, so I didn't believe this would be correct, leading me to believe out of the two answers, A was the correct option.",A,"1,2,3 & 4"

I then found evidence to suggest that the response in this situation would most likely result in a abdominal CT scan. I first found that ""A unilateral right-sided varicocele is an uncommon finding and, if found, should prompt an evaluation of the retroperitoneum to exclude a mass obstructing the downstream testicular vein."". I then understood that the retroperitoneum is part of the abdominal cavity, and an evaluation was often done with CT and/or ultrasound. 

To further my confidence that B was the correct answer, I also found another resource that read ""Varicoceles can rarely be caused by retroperitoneal masses that obstruct the spermatic vein. Further imaging with CT or ultrasound of the abdomen and pelvis is indicated for varicoceles that are of sudden onset, do not reduce in size with the patient supine, or occur on the right side."".

First, the context of the case is a serious legal matter involving a fatal accident. Understanding hearsay rules and their exceptions, I noted that statements made by someone who believes they are about to die, known as dying declarations, are often admissible. Legal precedents indicate that judges can consider hearsay when deciding on preliminary issues, particularly in the context of dying declarations.

The case featured an Agent who was using thermal imaging to find evidence if the person inside the home is creating illegal drugs.
